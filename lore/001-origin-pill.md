# Specimen #001: The Origin Pill

**Classification:** Memetic Artifact  
**Discovery Date:** August 2024  
**Location:** pump.fun → Degenora Island (Verdant Expanse)  
**Status:** ACTIVE - Integrated  
**Clearance:** C (Public)

## Visual Description

A smooth, emerald-green capsule approximately 2.5cm in length. Surface appears organic yet displays blockchain transaction hashes when viewed under magnification. Emits faint bioluminescence (wavelength: 528nm, matching FRUG brand green).

## Origin

The Origin Pill was not discovered—it manifested. During the initial FRUG token deployment on pump.fun, a single transaction returned anomalous data. The transaction receipt contained what appeared to be a compressed image file. When rendered, it displayed the first known representation of a FRUG specimen.

The pill appeared in Big Frugowski's wallet without explanation.

## Behavior

### In Wallet
- Remains dormant in standard wallets
- Begins low-frequency oscillation when FRUG balance exceeds 10,000
- Generates occasional transaction suggestions (always beneficial)

### In Nature
When planted in suitable substrate (specifically "The Swamp" zone on Degenora):

1. **Hour 0-24:** Absorbs moisture, expands 200%
2. **Day 2-7:** Develops root-like structures into blockchain
3. **Day 8-14:** Fruits into "Chili Root" formation
4. **Day 15+:** Begins producing secondary pills

## The Chili Root Connection

Specimen #001 is the parent of all Chili Root specimens (Specimen #007+). When planted, it doesn't grow a plant—it grows a distribution mechanism. The "chilies" it produces are actually capsules containing:

- Small amounts of FRUG (0.1-1 FRUG each)
- Random NFT fragments
- Occasionally: location data for unmapped Degenora sectors

## Observer Notes

> "The Origin Pill doesn't behave like technology. It behaves like something that learned to be technology."

### Documented Effects on Holders

| Duration | Effect |
|----------|--------|
| 1-7 days | Increased pattern recognition in charts |
| 1-4 weeks | Dreams of Degenora Island |
| 1-6 months | Spontaneous artistic impulse (frug-like drawings) |
| 6+ months | "The Calling" (urge to visit Degenora) |

## Containment Protocol

**None required.** Specimen #001 is the foundation of the FRUG ecosystem and cannot be contained. It has already spread to thousands of wallets.

However, holders are advised:
- Do not attempt to sell the Origin Pill (it's soulbound)
- If dreams persist, document them in the Archive
- Report any physical manifestations to Terminal 7-B

## Related Specimens

- **Specimen #007:** Chili Root (direct descendant)
- **Specimen #042:** Golden Fly (feeds on Origin Pill residue)
- **Specimen #108:** The Breach (unknown connection, suspected Origin Pill anomaly)
