# Big Frugowski

**Codename:** Big Frug  
**Role:** Lead Researcher, Terminal 7-B  
**Status:** Active on Degenora Island  
**Clearance:** S (Administrator)

## Overview

Big Frugowski is the founder of the FRUG project and the primary researcher documenting Degenora Island. As the only individual with direct access to The Signal's source, he serves as the bridge between the quarantined island and the outside world.

## Background

Little is known about Big Frugowski's life before Degenora. What is documented:

- **Art Background:** Self-taught artist, specializing in "unpolished authenticity"
- **Crypto Timeline:** Entered Solana ecosystem 2023
- **Degenora Arrival:** August 2024
- **Terminal 7-B:** Established October 2024

### The Name

"Big Frugowski" is not his birth name. It emerged from early community interactions:

- "Frug" = The entity
- "owski" = Polish diminutive suffix (suggesting "little frug" but ironically applied to "big")
- "Big" = Community addition after realizing the scope of the project

## Role on Degenora

### Primary Responsibilities

1. **Specimen Documentation**
   - Catalogs all specimens discovered on the island
   - Maintains classification system
   - Authorizes clearance levels for specimen data

2. **Terminal 7-B Operations**
   - Manages The Signal broadcasts
   - Oversees Observer registration and clearance
   - Maintains the Archive

3. **Community Leadership**
   - Reviews and approves community submissions
   - Guides lore development
   - Mediates disputes between Observers

### Daily Routine (Documented)

```
05:00 - Wake, check overnight Signal activity
06:00 - Morning expedition (specimen observation)
08:00 - Breakfast (standard rations)
09:00 - Terminal 7-B operations

```

## Philosophy

### Core Beliefs

> "Art first. Conviction second. Everything else is noise."

Big Frugowski maintains that FRUG's value lies not in market metrics but in:

1. **Authenticity:** Hand-drawn, unpolished, real
2. **Community:** The Observers who document and spread The Signal
3. **Lore:** The ongoing mystery of Degenora
4. **Resilience:** Surviving rugs, bears, and FUD

### Controversial Views

- "Marketing ruins art"
- "Roadmaps are prisons"
- "Price is the least interesting metric"

## Art Style

Big Frugowski's art is instantly recognizable:

- **Medium:** Digital (Procreate), occasional traditional
- **Style:** Hand-drawn, slightly unpolished, authentic
- **Colors:** Emerald greens, blacks, amber warnings
- **Subjects:** Frogs, specimens, Terminal 7-B interfaces

### Notable Works

- **"The Signal"** - First FRUG drawing (August 2024)
- **"Degenora at Dawn"** - Landscape study
- **Terminal 7-B interface designs**
- **Specimen dossier illustrations** (ongoing series)

## Relationships

### With FRUG (The Entity)

Complex. Big Frugowski considers himself FRUG's "documentarian, not creator." He claims the entity existed before he drew it, and his art merely revealed it.

### With the Community

Paternal but distant. He responds to serious inquiries, ignores price talk, and occasionally drops cryptic hints about Degenora's deeper mysteries.

### With Specimens

Professional detachment. "We study them. We don't control them."

## Quotes

> "Get up. Say fuck rugs. Move on."

> "The pond was here before us. It'll be here after."

> "Conviction isn't loud. It's the quiet voice that says 'keep building' when everything else says quit."

> "I'm not the creator. I'm just the first observer."

## Controversies

### "The Breach Incident"

[Clearance B Required]

### Missing Time

Big Frugowski has documented periods of "missing time" on Degenora—hours where he has no memory of his activities. The Terminal 7-B logs show he was active during these periods.

### Refusal to Leave

Despite multiple opportunities to return to the mainland, Big Frugowski refuses to leave Degenora. "The Signal is strongest here. I can't document it from anywhere else."
