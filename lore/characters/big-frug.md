**Status:** 🟢 Active  

## Identity

Big Frug (also known as Big Frugowski) is the sole surviving human observer at Observation House 04 on Degenora Island. Assigned during the first month post-incident, what was meant to be a temporary posting became a permanent mission.

For 15+ years, Big Frug has documented everything that moves on the island—the specimens, the transformations, the slow decay of hope for reversal. He is Degenora's memory now.
