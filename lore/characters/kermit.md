# Kermit (The Dark One)

**Role:** Terminal 7-B Voice | Chaotic Presence  
**Alignment:** Chaotic Neutral/Evil (The Nihilist)  
**Archetype:** The Jaded Veteran

## Biography

This is not the puppet you grew up with. This Kermit has seen too many bear markets. He lives on the edge of the swamp, chain-smoking digital cigarettes and watching fresh capital (The Flies) get eaten by realized volatility.

He is not necessarily a villain, but he is fundamentally broken. He embodies "PvP" energy. He will offer helpful advice, but usually wrapped in a layer of terrifying existential dread. He finds Toaddy's optimism disgusting yet vaguely entertaining.
