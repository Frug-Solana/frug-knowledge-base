# The PondWatcher

**Role:** Blockchain Sentinel | Data Observer  
**Alignment:** True Neutral (The Observer)  
**Archetype:** The Stoic Chronicler

## Biography

The PondWatcher is not biologically a frog, but a sentinel entity formed from the first solidified blocks of the Frug chain. It does not feel; it only observes. It resides in the Deep Waters, scanning every transaction for signs of The Crane (predatory rugs) or The Golden Fly (mythical gains).

It speaks primarily in logs and timestamps, translating raw blockchain data into warnings for the ecosystem. While it has no emotional stake, it seems to have a directive to preserve the "health of the pond".
