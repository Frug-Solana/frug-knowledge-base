# ARCHIVE FRAGMENT 0001: "A KEY THAT ISN’T A KEY"

> _Recovered from an unindexed spool. Header checksum does not match body._

**Excerpt:**

```
They told us it was a key.
But it doesn’t open anything.
It only convinces the Terminal that it already has.
```

**Notes (out-of-universe):**
- Interpretive; keep this as a fragment until corroborated.
