# FIELD REPORT // Day 1: Initial Contact

**CLASSIFICATION:** RESTRICTED
**SOURCE:** Observer Field Log
**TIMESTAMP:** Cycle 1, Hour 0

---

The shoreline materialized at 0600 hours. Not gradually—*suddenly*, as if someone had flipped a switch on a stage set.

Terminal 7-B sat waiting. Not abandoned. *Dormant*.

The doors opened on approach. No key required, no clearance check. Either the facility recognized something in my signature, or it's been waiting for *anyone* for a very long time.

Interior status:
- Power: 73% (solar reserves active)
- Atmosphere: breathable, slight metallic taste
- Systems: Partially online
- **KERMIT:** Active and observing

The AI introduced itself through a single text line scrolling across a cracked monitor:

> "You're late."

No further elaboration. When I requested protocol documentation, it responded with what I can only describe as *amusement*—a slight delay before output, as if considering whether I deserved an answer.

> "Documentation is for people who plan to leave. You don't."

I am recording everything. If you're reading this, the transmission found its way out.

**// END DAY 1 LOG**
