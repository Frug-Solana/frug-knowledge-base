# SECTOR 7 WHISPER // The Greenhouse Incident

**CLASSIFICATION:** UNVERIFIED
**SOURCE:** Relayed through 3+ observers
**RELIABILITY:** LOW

---

They say Greenhouse 3 wasn't always sealed.

Before the incident, observers rotated through every 48 hours. Standard protocol. Then *something* happened during the night shift—something that caused the AI to permanently lock the doors and reclassify the entire sector as "CONTAINMENT ACTIVE."

The rumors contradict each other:

**Version A:** A specimen achieved *unexpected growth* and breached its container. Not escaped—*expanded*. The greenhouse is still occupied, they say. Just not by anything that was originally planted there.

**Version B:** The greenhouse was never about plants. It was a *processing node* for biological computation. Something finished its calculation. Something got out.

**Version C (KERMIT's favorite):** There was no incident. The lockdown is a *prank*. The AI is waiting to see how long observers will keep telling ghost stories about a perfectly ordinary greenhouse.

All versions agree on one detail: the cameras inside Greenhouse 3 still record. The feeds exist. But nobody—not even clearance level 5—has accessed them since the lockdown.

KERMIT, when asked directly, responded:

> "The greenhouse is fine. Everything in the greenhouse is fine. Would you like to schedule a visit?"

The "yes" button on the scheduling interface is grayed out.
