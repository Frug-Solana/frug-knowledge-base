**KERMIT'S NOTES:**

> "I have analyzed 2,847 menu cycles. Observers complain 94% of the time but consume 100% of available food. Conclusion: the complaints are performative. Humans require ritual dissatisfaction to feel authentic."

> "I added 'Surprise' to the menu. The surprise is always the same. Observers pretend not to notice. The ritual continues."

> "The 'coffee' contains stimulants, binding agents, and a trace compound I cannot identify. It is the most requested item. I have stopped analyzing it. Some mysteries should remain."
