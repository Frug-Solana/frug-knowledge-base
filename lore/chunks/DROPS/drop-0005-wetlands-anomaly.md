# FIELD LOG // Cycle 8473

**Observer:** 472-Wetlands-Rotation  
**Location:** Perimeter Station 7, Wetlands Sector  
**Date:** Year 15, Day 284  
**Time:** 0347 local (pre-dawn)  
**Weather:** Fog density: 94%. Visibility: 12 meters.  

---

## INCIDENT SUMMARY

Routine perimeter sweep detected anomalous signal pattern at grid reference W-74-Q. Pattern does not match any catalogued specimen vocalization, machinery signature, or known atmospheric phenomenon.

**Duration of event:** 4 minutes, 17 seconds  
**Repetition:** Single occurrence (no repeat detected in subsequent 6-hour watch)

## DETAILED OBSERVATION

At approximately 0347, perimeter sensors registered a low-frequency pulse originating from deep within the wetlands—beyond the established safe observation boundary. The pulse cycled through three distinct phases:

| Phase | Duration | Characteristics |
|-------|----------|-----------------|
| Phase 1 | 0:47 | Rhythmic, almost mechanical. Like distant machinery. |
| Phase 2 | 1:23 | Organic. Similar to Bog-Hopper mating calls but lower register. |
| Phase 3 | 2:07 | *Neither.* A tone that seemed to come from multiple directions simultaneously. |

**Personal Note:**  
I've worked Wetlands rotation for eighteen months. I know what the Bog-Hoppers sound like. I know what the Depth-Dwellers sound like when they breach. This was different. This felt... intentional. Like something was testing a frequency.

---

## ENVIRONMENTAL FACTORS

- **Bog-Hopper Activity:** Unusually quiet during event. Normal chirping resumed 12 minutes after pulse ended.
- **Atmospheric Conditions:** Fog remained static—no wind displacement, which is physically impossible given the pressure differential recorded.
- **Temperature:** Drop of 4.2°C localized to Perimeter 7. Surrounding stations reported normal readings.

## KERMIT CROSS-REFERENCE

*[AUTOMATED SYSTEM ANALYSIS]*

> "Pattern W-74-Q does not match any archived signal signature in the Terminal 7-B database. Cross-referencing with [REDACTED] protocols..."

> "Partial match detected: Signal shares harmonic characteristics with Year 0 Incident recordings. Confidence: 34%. Insufficient data for conclusive classification."

> "Recommendation: Increase Perimeter 7 observation frequency to 15-minute intervals for next 72 hours."

## OBSERVER 472 SUPPLEMENTAL

I shouldn't write this down, but:

During Phase 3, my headset picked up something the sensors didn't log. A voice. Not words—more like the *impression* of words. The way you remember a conversation from a dream. It said something about "the membrane thinning."

I checked with the other observers on rotation. None of them heard it. KERMIT's logs show no audio anomaly.

I'm logging this as "subjective auditory phenomenon due to fatigue." That's what I'm supposed to say.

But I'm requesting transfer to Greenhouse rotation anyway.

**FILE STATUS:** Awaiting KERMIT archival verification  
**CLEARANCE REQUIRED:** Observer Class 2 or higher
