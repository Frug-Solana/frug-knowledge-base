description: |
  Extruded from specialized spinnerets on the Void Crawler's ventral
  surface, this silk possesses anomalous material properties that
  defy conventional physics. The fibers appear to absorb light,
  rendering objects wrapped in it difficult to perceive—especially
  in low-light conditions.

  **Physical Properties:**
  - Tensile strength: 3.2 GPa (comparable to carbon nanotubes)
  - Weight: 0.8 g/m (lighter than nylon)
  - Color: Perfect light-absorbing black
  - Texture: Smooth, slightly oily

  **Unique Characteristics:**
  - Light absorption: 99.97% of visible spectrum
  - Thermal signature: Minimal (stealth applications)
  - Sound dampening: 85% noise reduction
  - Signal interference: Mild (disrupts basic electronics)

  **Processing Requirements:**
  Raw silk must be treated before use:
  1. Neutralize acidic coating (water rinse insufficient)
  2. Stretch and align fibers under tension
  3. Cure with UV light for 4 hours
  4. Store in light-tight containers

  **Terminal 7-B Addendum:**
  > "We lost two apprentices learning how to harvest this stuff.
  > Void Crawlers don't appreciate people stealing their nest lining.
  > 
  > Pro tip: Wait for the Crawler to leave. Don't try to collect
  > while it's home. Rookie mistake. Expensive mistake."
