description: |
  A captured acoustic anomaly—a literal piece of the Hollow Choir's
  song preserved in crystallized Resonance energy. These echoes
  manifest only under specific conditions during Choir manifestation
  events, solidifying from raw sound into tangible matter as the
  dimensional fabric tears and repairs itself.

  **Physical Properties:**
  - Appearance: Shifting iridescent sphere, 3cm diameter
  - Weight: Negligible (appears weightless)
  - Sound: Constant subsonic hum, varies by holder
  - Temperature: Matches ambient (feels "neutral")

  **Consumption Effects:**
  When ingested (not recommended without medical supervision):
  - Immediate: Intense synesthesia lasting 10 minutes
  - Permanent: +5% resistance to all Signal-based effects
  - Permanent: "Echo Sense"—detect Hollow Choir proximity
  - Risk: 10% chance of "Hollow" debuff (see below)

  **The Hollow Debuff:**
  If consumption fails:
  - Duration: 24 hours
  - Effects: 
    - Cannot hear normal sounds (only echoes)
    - -20% communication effectiveness
    - Attracts Void creatures
    - Random auditory hallucinations
  - Cure: Requires "Clarity Serum" or 24h natural duration

  **Terminal 7-B Addendum:**
  > "First researcher to consume one reported 'understanding the
  > universe' for about six hours. Then he tried to walk into the
  > Swamp 'to join the chorus.' 
  >
  > We pulled him out. He doesn't speak anymore. Just hums.
  > 
  > The echo works. The echo has costs."
