description: |
  A compressed cluster of dormant spores harvested from Signal-
  Resonant Fungus colonies. When disturbed, these spores release
  a faint luminescent cloud that temporarily enhances metabolic
  processes in most organic lifeforms—including humans.

  **Physical Properties:**
  - Appearance: Glowing blue-green pellets, 5mm diameter
  - Weight: 0.2g per cluster
  - Shelf life: 7 days (refrigerated), 2 days (ambient)
  - Smell: Earthy, slightly metallic

  **Consumption Guidelines:**
  - **Raw:** Immediate HP regen + speed boost
  - **Cooked:** Double HP regen, no speed boost
  - **Fermented:** Extended duration (5 min), higher infection risk

  **Spore Infected Debuff (5% chance):**
  - Duration: 30 minutes
  - Effects:
    - Faint bioluminescence (stealth penalty)
    - Emit spore cloud when damaged
    - Attracts Signal-sensitive creatures
  - Neutral: Friendly to Fungus creatures

  **Terminal 7-B Addendum:**
  > "Cafeteria tried to make 'spore bread.' Three people ended up
  > glowing for a week. Doc Ramirez said it was harmless. They
  > said it was 'inconvenient during night operations.'
  > 
  > Bread's banned now. Spores still sold in commissary.
  > Supply and demand, people."
