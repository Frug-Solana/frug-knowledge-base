description: |
  A fractured fragment of larger Crystal Memory formations. These shards
  retain residual Signal resonance even when separated from the parent
  structure. The hum they produce correlates with proximity to active
  Signal sources—useful for navigation, maddening for sleep.

  **Physical Properties:**
  - Irregular geometric facets
  - Soft blue-white luminescence
  - Temperature: slightly warm to touch
  - Weight: 12 grams average

  **Collection Hazards:**
  Extended exposure (>30 minutes unshielded) may cause:
  - Mild auditory hallucinations (ringing, voices)
  - Heightened emotional response
  - Temporary synesthesia (hearing colors, tasting sounds)

  **Storage Protocol:**
  Keep in grounded metal containers. Do not store near:
  - Living specimens
  - Electronic recording devices
  - Other Resonance Crystals (risk of harmonic cascade)

  **Terminal 7-B Addendum:**
  > "First ones to collect these thought they were pretty. Put 'em in
  > mason jars on their desks. Two days later, three researchers
  > reported 'the singing' and one tried to eat his clipboard.
  > 
  > Grounded containers. Always."
