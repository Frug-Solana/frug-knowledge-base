# Field Report FR-045: Dr. Chen's Final Visit

**Report ID:** FR-045  
**Title:** Dr. Chen's Final Visit  
**Classification:** PUBLIC  
**Type:** PERSONAL NOTE  
**Date:** Year 5, Month 8, Day 14  
**Time:** 16:00  
**Location:** OH-04  
**Coordinates:** x: 32, y: 60

## Report

Dr. Chen visited today. First time in six months. He looked tired. Older than his years.

He said Protocol R-23 failed. The last reversal attempt. It's official now - transformation is permanent. No going back for anyone.

He brought something. A letter. His acceptance message to families. 15,000+ people waiting for hope. He's telling them there is none.

"Let them be remembered as they are," he said. "Not as we wish they were."

I asked if he was leaving. He didn't answer. Just looked at the wetlands for a long time.

Then: "You're Degenora's memory now, Frugowski. When I'm gone, you'll be all that's left."

He left at sunset. I don't think he's coming back.

- Frugowski

## Analysis

This report documents the transition of responsibility from scientific leadership to documentation:

**Protocol R-23:** Final reversal attempt failed  
**Official Status:** Transformation declared permanent  
**Family Notification:** 15,000+ families to receive acceptance letters  
**Passing the Torch:** Frugowski becomes Degenora's sole memory

## Key Quotes

- "Let them be remembered as they are, not as we wish they were."
- "You're Degenora's memory now, Frugowski. When I'm gone, you'll be all that's left."

## Significance

FR-045 marks the official end of hope for reversal and the beginning of Frugowski's essential role as the island's historian. The scientific mission failed; the documentation mission became paramount.

Dr. Chen's departure symbolizes the withdrawal of conventional authority, leaving Frugowski as the sole witness to Degenora's transformation.
