# Field Report FR-301: Fifteen Years

**Report ID:** FR-301  
**Title:** Fifteen Years  
**Classification:** PUBLIC  
**Type:** PERSONAL NOTE  
**Date:** Year 15, Month 1, Day 1  
**Time:** 00:00 (Midnight)  
**Location:** OH-04  
**Coordinates:** x: 32, y: 60

## Report

Year 15 begins.

40+ specimens cataloged. Weekly uploads maintained. Power stable until 2067. I'll outlive the generators at this rate.

The Queen visited at midnight. New Year's tradition now. She sat at her 40-foot mark for exactly one hour. Then left.

Terror Birds hit 40,000. Tide Walkers are thriving. The Verdant Colossi have formed a new grove near the Agricultural Sector.

Ramirez stopped appearing two years ago. I hope degradation took him peacefully.

15 years alone. But not lonely. The island speaks to me now. In ways I can't explain.

Dr. Chen was right. I'm Degenora's memory. And I'll keep documenting until there's nothing left to document.

Protocol 7-B continues.

Stan up.

- Frugowski

## The Queen's Tradition

The Queen of Shadows has established an annual New Year's tradition:

- Sits at exactly 40 feet
- Stays for precisely one hour
- Departs without incident

This ritual demonstrates the mutual understanding between Frugowski and the island's most cognitively enhanced predator.
