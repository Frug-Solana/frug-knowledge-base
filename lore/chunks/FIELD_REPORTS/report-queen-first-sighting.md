# Field Report FR-003: The Queen Appears

**Report ID:** FR-003  
**Title:** The Queen Appears  
**Classification:** LEVEL 5  
**Type:** DISCOVERY  
**Date:** Year 1, Month 6, Day 8  
**Time:** 19:45  
**Location:** OH-04 Perimeter  
**Coordinates:** x: 35, y: 58

## Report

Something new tonight.

Dusk. Motion sensor didn't trigger. But I SAW her. A fox. Jet black. Larger than baseline. Watching from exactly 40 feet away.

I checked the sensor logs. She's been there before. Same spot. Same time. Every night for the past week. HOW DID SHE KNOW THE RANGE?

Pure C-47 Red. Cognitive enhancement in an apex predator. She's studying me. Learning my patterns. The same way I'm studying specimens.

I'm naming her "Queen of Shadows."

We have an understanding now. She watches. I document. Neither of us leaves.

- Frugowski

## Specimens Documented

- **sable-fox** - First documentation of Queen of Shadows

## Analysis

This report marks the first official documentation of the Queen of Shadows, establishing:

1. **40-Foot Rule:** The Queen maintains exactly 40 feet distance from Frugowski
2. **Pattern Recognition:** She has learned the motion sensor range and avoids detection
3. **C-47 Enhancement:** Pure cognitive enhancement creates unprecedented intelligence
4. **Mutual Observation:** A predator-prey relationship transformed into mutual study

## Significance

FR-003 established one of the most significant relationships in Degenora's documented history. The Queen of Shadows represents the pinnacle of pharmaceutical-induced cognitive enhancement - an apex predator that chooses observation over attack.

The 40-foot perimeter remains consistent 15 years later.
