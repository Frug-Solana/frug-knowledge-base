# Field Report FR-012: Ramirez Sighting

**Report ID:** FR-012  
**Title:** Ramirez Sighting  
**Classification:** LEVEL 5  
**Type:** PERSONAL NOTE  
**Date:** Year 2, Month 1, Day 22  
**Time:** 11:30  
**Location:** Residential Zone Border  
**Coordinates:** x: 60, y: 42

## Report

I saw Ramirez today. Patient Zero.

He was standing at the edge of the Residential Zone. Still mostly human-shaped. He looked at me. I think he recognized me.

He tried to speak. The sounds were... wrong. But I understood one word: "Sorry."

Year 1, he could still talk normally. Now, partial speech. Hybrid degradation is taking his voice.

He walked back into the zone. Slowly. Like he remembered how humans walk but had to think about it.

I didn't follow. Some things shouldn't be documented up close.

- Frugowski

## Specimens Documented

- **humanoid-ramirez** - Patient Zero, Year 2 status

## Analysis

This report documents the progressive nature of hybrid degradation:

**Year 1:** Normal speech capability  
**Year 2:** Partial speech, degraded vocalization  
**Key Word:** "Sorry" - possible recognition of transformation's impact

## Observations

1. **Cognitive Retention:** Ramirez recognized Frugowski
2. **Motor Function:** Movement became deliberate rather than natural
3. **Communication:** One-word speech suggests limited but present language capacity
4. **Boundaries:** Frugowski chose not to pursue documentation

## Significance

FR-012 humanizes the transformation process. Ramirez, the first affected, demonstrates that consciousness persists even as physical form degrades. His apology suggests awareness of what was lost.

Ramirez was last seen in Year 13.
