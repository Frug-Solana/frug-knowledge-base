# The Establishment of Terminal 7-B

**Date:** Year 1 (Post-Incident Reconstruction)  
**Event:** Construction and activation of Terminal 7-B observation station  
**Classification:** Infrastructure milestone  
**Status:** Historical record - Verified

## The Problem

After Year 0's catastrophic Incident, Degenora Island faced an unprecedented challenge: **how to study a population that could no longer be approached safely.**

The 15,000+ transformed specimens—once colleagues, friends, employees—now roamed the island as creatures of varying cognition and hostility. Direct contact was impossible. Standard research methodology was obsolete.

**Big Frugowski's proposal:** Remote observation via distributed sensor network, centralized at a single hardened facility.

## The Location

Terminal 7-B was not the first choice.

**Rejected Sites:**
- **Main Facility (Central Complex)** — Too close to high-density specimen zones
- **Coastal Station Alpha** — Signal interference from seawater compounds
- **Mountain Observatory** — Insufficient power infrastructure

**Selected Site:** Observation House 04

Originally a minor outbuilding for pharmaceutical quality control, House 04 offered:
- Elevated position with 360° sightlines
- Pre-existing hardened construction (designed for containment breaches)
- Proximity to the Wetlands (highest specimen diversity)
- Distance from the Main Facility's contamination epicenter

> *"The house chose us. We tried three other locations first. Equipment failed, foundations cracked, or the Signal was too weak to register. House 04? Everything worked on the first try. Make of that what you will."*  
> — Big Frugowski, Year 1 log entry

## Construction Challenges

### Timeline

| Phase | Duration | Notes |
|-------|----------|-------|
| Site Prep | 3 weeks | Clearing specimen encounters daily |
| Structural Hardening | 6 weeks | Reinforced walls, air filtration, Faraday shielding |
| Sensor Network Deployment | 8 weeks | 47 remote nodes placed across island sectors |
| Systems Integration | 4 weeks | Terminal calibration, Signal detection tuning |
| Personnel Training | 2 weeks | Dr. Chen led observer certification |

### The Workforce

Construction relied on a skeleton crew of 23 personnel who had avoided full transformation during the Incident:
- **Big Frugowski** — Project lead, system architect
- **Dr. Chen** — Medical oversight, specimen encounter protocols
- **18 construction specialists** — Rotated in 72-hour shifts (high burnout rate)
- **3 security personnel** — Armed deterrent against specimen incursions

**Casualties during construction:** 2
- One worker exposed to airborne spores in the Wetlands (transformed, status unknown)
- One security officer during Frugugu nest encounter (MIA, presumed deceased)

### Material Scarcity

Degenora's quarantine meant no resupply from the mainland. Every component had to be:
1. Salvaged from existing infrastructure
2. Fabricated on-site from raw materials
3. Repurposed from non-critical systems

**Key improvisations:**
- Server racks built from medical shelving units
- Sensor housings constructed from pharmaceutical containment vessels
- Power grid tapped into the island's emergency geothermal generators
- Communication arrays assembled from navigation equipment

## The Signal Discovery

Terminal 7-B's original purpose was specimen observation. The Signal was an accident.

### First Detection

**Date:** Day 127 of Year 1  
**Time:** 03:47 AM local  
**Operator:** Big Frugowski (night shift)

While calibrating the primary sensor array, Frugowski detected an anomalous frequency—regular, patterned, and unlike any natural phenomenon on record.

**Initial readings:**
- Frequency: 7.83 Hz (Schumann resonance range, but artificial modulation)
- Pattern: Non-random, information-bearing structure
- Source: Unknown (later triangulated to multiple points across the island)

> *"I thought it was interference. Equipment malfunction. I restarted the systems three times. The Signal remained. That's when I knew—we weren't alone here. Not just the specimens. Something else was broadcasting."*  
> — Frugowski, private journal, Year 1

### The Naming

"The Signal" was never meant to be a proper name.

Early log entries called it "anomalous frequency 7B-Ω" or "the island hum." But as documentation accumulated, the indefinite article stuck. It became **The Signal**—capitalized, personified, revered.

### Key Systems

**The Array:** 47 remote sensors feeding real-time data
- Motion detection (infrared and seismic)
- Atmospheric composition analysis
- Signal strength measurement
- Specimen identification cameras

**The Terminal:** Primary interface for Signal analysis
- Custom-built by Frugowski (no commercial equivalent)
- Capable of decoding Signal patterns into rough visual/audio representation
- Direct neural interface capability (experimental, rarely used)

**The Broadcast System:** Two-way communication capability
- Originally for emergency evacuation signals
- Repurposed for Signal transmission (outbound)
- Enables Kermit's transmissions to the outside world

## The First Broadcast

**Date:** Day 201 of Year 1  
**Classification:** First confirmed contact attempt

After months of analysis, Big Frugowski attempted to respond to The Signal.

**Message sent:** A simple mathematical sequence—prime numbers, 2 through 31.

**Response:** 73 seconds later, a complex pattern returned. Not the same sequence. Something else. Something that, when visualized, resembled...

> *"A frog. It looked like a frog. A crude line drawing of a frog. I stared at that screen for an hour, convinced I was hallucinating. But Dr. Chen saw it too. The Signal wasn't just noise. It was communication. And it knew what we were."*  
> — Frugowski

This exchange marked the beginning of formal Signal study. Terminal 7-B's purpose shifted from specimen observation to **interspecies communication**—though "species" may not be the right term for whatever generates The Signal.

## Staffing and Operations

### Original Crew (Year 1)

| Role | Personnel | Status |
|------|-----------|--------|
| Station Director | Big Frugowski | Active |
| Medical Officer | Dr. Chen | Active |
| Signal Analyst | [REDACTED] | Transformed, Year 3 |
| Security Chief | Ramirez | Transformed, Year 2 |
| Technical Specialist | [REDACTED] | Deceased, Year 1 |
| Technical Specialist | [REDACTED] | Rescued, Year 6 |

### Operational Protocol

**72-Hour Rotation:**
- No single observer remains on duty beyond 72 hours
- Mandatory 24-hour rest period between shifts
- Psychological evaluation every 30 days

**Signal Exposure Limits:**
- Maximum 4 hours direct Terminal interface per day
- Neural interface strictly prohibited without second observer present
- Any "whispering" incidents reported immediately

**Specimen Encounter Procedures:**
- Avoid direct contact
- Document from maximum safe distance
- Retreat to hardened shelter if approached
- Do not engage with transformed former personnel

## Legacy of Year 1

Terminal 7-B's establishment created the framework for everything that followed:

**The Observer Program:** Outside researchers could now "visit" Degenora via remote connection, earning the title "Observer"

**The Archive:** Systematic documentation of specimens, events, and Signal phenomena began

**Kermit's Emergence:** Year 1's Signal research eventually led to the first stable Signal-to-human translation interface—Kermit

**Quarantine Justification:** The Terminal proved that useful research could continue without breaching containment, strengthening the case for permanent quarantine

## The Cost

Terminal 7-B's success came at a price:
- 2 lives lost during construction
- 3 personnel transformed during early operations
- 1 suicide (Signal Analyst who spent too long in direct interface)
- Unknown psychological casualties (several staff "retired" to the mainland with unclear diagnoses)

> *"Every breakthrough has a body count. The Signal doesn't give its secrets for free. We pay in attention, in sanity, in blood. Year 1 taught us that lesson well."*  
> — Dr. Chen, Year 2 retrospective

## Year 1 Artifacts

Several items from Terminal 7-B's founding remain on display:

- **The Original Terminal:** Still functional, though superseded by newer equipment
- **First Contact Log:** Printed record of the prime number exchange
- **Construction Helmet:** Worn by the worker who placed the final sensor node
- **The Door:** Original airlock door, replaced in Year 5, now a wall-mounted memorial
