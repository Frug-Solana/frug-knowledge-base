# The Rug - From FLOG to FRUG

**Date:** Year -1 (Pre-FRUG Era)  
**Event:** Token transformation via airdrop  
**Classification:** Origin event  
**Status:** Historical record - Verified

## The FLOG Era

Before FRUG, there was FLOG.

FLOG was launched as a standard meme coin on Solana. The token gained modest traction, building a small community of believers. Then, without warning, the original developer abandoned the project.

**The rug pulled. The floor fell out. FLOG was dead.**

But something unexpected happened.

## The Rebirth

Instead of dispersing, the community rallied. A grassroots effort emerged to create a successor token - FRUG - and airdrop it to every FLOG holder who stayed through the rug.

**Key details:**
- 1:1 airdrop ratio for FLOG holders
- No pre-mine for new developers
- Community-driven governance from day one
- Transparent tokenomics established

## Why It Matters

The rug event became FRUG's origin myth - proof that the community could survive anything. The "I've been rugged and I'm still here" mentality became core to FRUG identity.

**The lesson:** Not every rug is an ending. Sometimes it's a beginning.

## Timeline

| Event | Date | Impact |
|-------|------|--------|
| FLOG Launch | Pre-Year 0 | Initial community formed |
| The Rug | Year -1 | Developer abandonment |
| Community Rally | Year -1 | Decision to continue |
| FRUG Airdrop | Year 0 | 1:1 for FLOG holders |
| Degenora Launch | Year 0+ | Lore expansion begins |

## Legacy

The rug transformed FRUG from "just another meme coin" into a story of resilience. The Degenora narrative - a world of transformation and survival - directly mirrors the community's own origin.

**Everyone who was there for FLOG, stayed for FRUG.**
