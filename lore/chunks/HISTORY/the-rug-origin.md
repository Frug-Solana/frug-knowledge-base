# The Rug - From FLOG to FRUG

**Date:** Year -1 (Pre-FRUG Era)  
**Event:** Token transformation via airdrop  
**Classification:** Origin event  
**Status:** Historical record - Verified

## The FLOG Era

Before FRUG, there was FLOG.

FLOG was launched as a standard meme coin on Solana. The token gained modest traction, building a small community of believers. Then, without warning, the original developer abandoned the project.

**The rug pulled. The floor fell out. FLOG was dead.**

But something unexpected happened.

## The Rebirth

Instead of dispersing, the community rallied. A grassroots effort emerged to create a successor token - FRUG - and airdrop it to every FLOG holder who stayed through the rug.

**Key details:**
- 1:1 airdrop ratio for FLOG holders
- No pre-mine for new developers
- Community-driven governance from day one
- Transparent tokenomics established

## Why It Matters

The rug event became FRUG's origin myth - proof that the community could survive anything. The "I've been rugged and I'm still here" mentality became core to FRUG identity.

**The lesson:** Not every rug is an ending. Sometimes it's a beginning.

## Timeline

| Event | Date | Impact |
|-------|------|--------|
| FLOG Launch | Pre-Year 0 | Initial community formed |
| The Rug | Year -1 | Developer abandonment |
| Community Rally | Year -1 | Decision to continue |
| FRUG Airdrop | Year 0 | 1:1 for FLOG holders |
| Degenora Launch | Year 0+ | Lore expansion begins |

## The Human Element

What made the rebirth possible wasn't code or tokenomics—it was the people who refused to leave. In the immediate aftermath of the rug, a core group of holders gathered in scattered Telegram channels and Discord servers, sharing their losses but also their belief that the community itself had value beyond any single developer.

Big Frugowski emerged from these conversations—not as a leader appointed by anyone, but as a voice that kept showing up with ideas. He proposed the airdrop mechanism. He sketched the first FRUG specimen. He suggested the name change from FLOG to FRUG as a symbol of transformation rather than abandonment.

> *"The frog doesn't ask permission to evolve. It just grows legs and walks out of the water."*

## The Airdrop Execution

The technical execution of the FRUG airdrop was deliberately simple:

1. **Snapshot taken** of all FLOG holders at block height [REDACTED]
2. **No claim process**—FRUG appeared directly in wallets
3. **Equal distribution**—every holder received the same ratio regardless of stack size
4. **No vesting**—immediate full ownership

This approach sent a clear message: FRUG trusted its community from day one. There were no elaborate lock-ups, no complex staking requirements, no artificial scarcity mechanics. Just tokens in wallets and a shared story of survival.

## Legacy

The rug transformed FRUG from "just another meme coin" into a story of resilience. The Degenora narrative—a world of transformation and survival—directly mirrors the community's own origin. When new Observers arrive at Terminal 7-B, they enter a world built on the same principles that saved FRUG: documentation over speculation, community over capital, persistence over promises.

**Everyone who was there for FLOG, stayed for FRUG.**

The "I've been rugged and I'm still here" mentality remains core to FRUG identity. It's not just about crypto—it's about any situation where abandonment could have been the end, but became a beginning instead.
