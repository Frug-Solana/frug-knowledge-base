# Degenora Island - Overview

**Designation:** Degenora Island  
**Status:** Active quarantine zone - pharmaceutical contamination  
**Population:** Transformed specimens (former PSCL personnel and wildlife)  
**Current Era:** Year 15 post-incident

## Geography

Degenora is an isolated island ecosystem that has undergone radical transformation following a pharmaceutical contamination event. The island features diverse biomes including:

- **Wetlands:** Home to Bog Hoppers, Deep Dwellers, and Sludge Crawlers
- **Coastal Sector:** Territory of Tide Walkers and Deep Dweller surfacing events
- **Northern Sector:** Unconfirmed Mammoth Hybrid territory
- **Residential Zone:** Former PSCL living quarters, now home to humanoid specimens
- **Agricultural Sector:** Overgrown and reclaimed by Verdant Colossi
- **Deep Woods:** Shadow Jaguar territory
- **Obsidian Ridge:** Magnetic anomaly zone

## The Incident (Year 0)

All six pharmaceutical variant tanks ruptured simultaneously, exposing the entire island population to transformative compounds:

- C-47 (Red) - Cognitive enhancement
- E-01 (Orange) - Emotional modulation
- B-12X (Green) - Biological adaptation
- L-19 (Yellow) - Physical enhancement/endurance
- A-02 (Blue) - Aquatic adaptation
- P-?? (Unknown) - Stabilizing agent (trace amounts)

**Casualties:** 15,000+ personnel transformed
**Stable Case:** 1 (Big Frugowski)

## Current Ecosystem

**Documented Specimens:** 40+ cataloged species
**Population Highlights:**
- Terror Birds: 40,000+
- Bog Hoppers: 1,000+
- Tide Walkers: 80+
- Verdant Colossi: 50+
- Deep Dwellers: Unknown (rarely surface)
- Humanoid Specimens: 200+ estimated

## Infrastructure

**Main Facility:** Original PSCL headquarters, now partially abandoned
**Terminal 7-B:** Only functioning external connection
**Observation House 04:** Active documentation station
**Underground Labs:** Classified, possibly containing undocumented specimens

## Quarantine Status

The island remains under permanent quarantine. Protocol R-23 (reversal attempt) failed in Year 5. Transformation is now understood to be irreversible.

**Power Systems:** Self-sustaining until estimated 2067
**Monitoring:** Continuous via KERMIT AI and Frugowski documentation
**External Contact:** None since Year 6

## Notable Locations

- **Green Pond:** Pharmaceutical concentration site, Bog Hopper feeding ground
- **40-Foot Perimeter:** The Queen of Shadows' observation distance from OH-04
- **Founders Symbol Location:** x: 54, y: 47 (encrypted transmission site)
