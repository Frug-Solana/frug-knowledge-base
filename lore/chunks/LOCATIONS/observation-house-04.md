# Observation House 04 (OH-04)

**Designation:** Observation House 04  
**Coordinates:** x: 32, y: 60  
**Distance:** 3.2km from main facility  
**Status:** Permanent residence since Year 1

## Description

Observation House 04 serves as Big Frugowski's permanent residence and primary documentation station. Located at a strategic distance from the main facility, it provides optimal positioning for field observation while maintaining a safe buffer from the most active transformation zones.

## Function

**Primary Purpose:** Base of operations for Protocol 7-B documentation mission

**Residency:** Permanent home for Chief Documentation Officer since Year 1

**Observation:** Ideal vantage point for monitoring specimen activity

**Safety:** Positioned to leverage Frugowski's neutral pheromone signature for peaceful coexistence with nearby specimens

## History

Dr. Chen assigned Frugowski to OH-04 during the first month post-incident. What began as a temporary posting became permanent as the scope of the transformation became clear and Frugowski's unique stability made him the island's only viable long-term documentarian.

The house has been continuously occupied for 15 years, serving as both living quarters and the central hub for Frugowski's field documentation work.

## Relationship to Main Facility

At 3.2km distance, OH-04 maintains separation from the main PSCL facility while remaining connected through weekly uploads to Terminal 7-B. This positioning allows Frugowski to document the broader island ecosystem while maintaining access to the last functioning technology interface.

## Notable Features

- Equipped for long-term habitation
- Positioned near Bog Hopper territory
- Within observation range of the Queen of Shadows' 40-foot perimeter
- Serves as the origin point for all field reports FR-001 through FR-312
