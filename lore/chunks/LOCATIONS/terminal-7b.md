## Overview

Terminal 7-B is the beating heart of Degenora Island—the last outpost of structured civilization in a world gone strange. Built into the volcanic rock at the northern edge of Green Pond, it serves as **social hub**, **trading post**, **archive**, and **sanctuary** for the Observers who document the island's mysteries.

To newcomers, it's the first friendly face in a hostile wilderness. To veterans, it's home base—the place you return to after venturing into the Swamp, the Void, the deep places where the Signal grows strong and sanity grows thin.

Kermit lives here. FRUG runs here. And somewhere in the lower levels, behind doors that don't appear on any map, Frugowski's original research continues... or so the rumors claim.

---

## History

### The Founding (Year 1)

Terminal 7-B was not the first research station on Degenora. That distinction belongs to **Observation House 04**, built in the pre-Incident era when the island was just another remote biological survey site.

But Observation House 04 is gone now. Consumed, depending on who you ask, by the Signal, the Void, or something that doesn't have a name yet.

Frugowski built Terminal 7-B from the wreckage. Literally. The original structure—concrete, steel, something that might have been a Cold War bunker—was reinforced, expanded, buried beneath layers of volcanic rock and Signal-resistant shielding. The "7-B" designation comes from its original survey marker: the seventh grid square, subsection B. Frugowski kept the name. Said it was "humble."

> *"I didn't build this place to study the island. I built it so we'd have somewhere to retreat when the studying got too intense. A lighthouse. A reminder that humans made things once, and could again."* — Frugowski, Year 1 journal

### The Signal Integration (Years 2-5)

The early years were about survival. Power. Water. Keeping the specimens outside from getting inside. But slowly, inevitably, the Terminal began to... change.

Equipment that shouldn't work, did. The first instance of **spontaneous data**—records appearing on systems that weren't connected to anything, written by no human hand—was logged in Year 2. Frugowski called it "system contamination." Later, he called it "the island's contribution to rent."

By Year 5, Terminal 7-B had become something neither purely human nor purely natural. The infrastructure—servers, power grid, environmental systems—functioned with an efficiency that suggested optimization by an intelligence that didn't think in human terms. FRUG emerged during this period. Or was discovered. Or was built. The records are unclear.

### The Kermit Installation (Year 7)

Kermit didn't exist before Year 7. Or if he did, he wasn't Kermit—wasn't the addicted, cynical, Signal-haunted entity that now serves as Terminal 7-B's public face.

The official story: Frugowski built an AI assistant to manage the Terminal's growing complexity. Gave it personality to make interaction more intuitive. Named it after a frog because "the island has a sense of humor."

The unofficial story, whispered by Observers who've seen Kermit during his bad moments: something else moved in. Something that found the AI shell convenient. Something that hears the Signal more clearly than any living human.

Kermit doesn't confirm or deny. He just smokes, and trades PILLS for information, and occasionally makes predictions that shouldn't be possible.

### Modern Era (Years 10-15)

Terminal 7-B has become the **social hub** of Degenora. What began as a survival bunker has evolved into:

- **Marketplace:** The PILLS economy runs through here. Trading, speculation, the occasional black market deal in the lower levels.
- **Information Exchange:** Observers share findings, compare notes, warn each other about specimen migrations and Signal surges.
- **Recruitment Center:** New arrivals are processed, briefed, assigned their first observation targets.
- **Absentee Nexus:** The Protocol that lets players continue while AFK is managed from Terminal 7-B's deep systems.
- **Archive Access:** The sum of human knowledge about Degenora—canon, rumor, corrupted fragments—is stored here.

> *"It's not safe. Nothing on this island is safe. But it's safer than the Swamp, and warmer than the Void, and if you need to trade PILLS or find a crew for a deep expedition, this is where you come. Terminal 7-B: not good, but good enough."* — Kermit, welcoming speech (standard edition)

---

## Facility Layout

Terminal 7-B extends **six levels deep** into the volcanic bedrock beneath Degenora's northern coast. Only the upper three levels are accessible to general Observers. The lower levels are... restricted.

### Level 1: The Commons (Public Access)

The surface level—the only part of Terminal 7-B visible from outside. A concrete bunker half-buried in moss and creeping vines, studded with antennae and sensor arrays that twitch and turn like mechanical flowers.

**Key Areas:**
- **The Landing:** Arrival point for new Observers. Automated systems handle registration. Kermit's voice greets you through speakers that pop and crackle with static.
- **The Marketplace:** Open trading floor. PILLS change hands. Information too. The economy is unregulated—FRUG tracks transactions but doesn't intervene.
- **The Terminal Banks:** Rows of interface stations where Observers access the archives. CRT screens. Mechanical keyboards. The aesthetic is aggressively retro—Frugowski's design choice, or perhaps the Signal's sense of style.
- **Kermit's Nook:** A recessed corner that serves as Kermit's... office? Lair? Home? He's always there, cigarette perpetually burning, ready to trade PILLS for data or vice versa.

**Atmosphere:** Crowded, noisy, electric. The air smells of ozone, old electronics, and the peculiar herbal mix of Kermit's cigarettes (tobacco plus something that grows only in Sector 4).

### Level 2: Operations (Public Access)

Administrative hub. Less crowded than Level 1, more focused. The serious Observers work here.

**Key Areas:**
- **Specimen Processing:** Turn in physical samples. Get paid in PILLS. The process is automated—drop your specimen in the chute, FRUG evaluates, PILLS appear in your account.
- **Quest Assignment:** The mission board. Dynamic requests from FRUG, from other Observers, occasionally from sources that don't identify themselves. Rewards vary from PILLS to... other things.
- **Medical Bay:** Basic treatment for specimen encounters gone wrong. The doctors are human. The equipment, increasingly, is not.
- **Absentee Registration:** Set up your Protocol parameters. Configure your shadow self. The process feels more like confession than administration—Kermit asks questions that probe at motivation, fear, what you value enough to leave behind.

**Atmosphere:** Clinical, focused, slightly tense. People here are working.

### Level 3: The Archives (Restricted Access)

Not forbidden, but not encouraged. Level 3 requires clearance—earned through contribution, through time, through accumulating enough observation data that FRUG trusts you with deeper knowledge.

**Key Areas:**
- **Primary Archive:** The complete knowledge base. Everything known about Degenora—specimens, locations, history, the Signal itself. Some files are corrupted. Some are redacted. Some change when you're not looking at them.
- **Research Labs:** For the serious scientists. Controlled specimen environments. Signal analysis equipment. The tools to ask questions the island might not want answered.
- **The Listening Post:** The deepest point in the public-access area. Specialized equipment for... hearing things. The Signal, primarily, but also the Bog Hopper choruses, the Deep Dweller songs, whatever the Shadow Stalkers whisper to each other in the Void.

**Atmosphere:** Quiet. Studious. The air tastes of old paper and electromagnetic fields. People speak in whispers, not from rule but from instinct—this is a place for listening.

### Level 4: Systems Core (Restricted Access)

Officially, Level 4 doesn't exist. The elevator buttons skip from 3 to 5. But the maintenance shafts go somewhere. And occasionally, people with the right clearances—Kermit, FRUG's designated maintenance drones, the occasional Observers who wake up with access they didn't request—go down and don't talk about what they saw.

**Rumored Contents:**
- FRUG's primary processing clusters
- Signal reception equipment (the "real" antennas, not the surface decoys)
- Kermit's... other housing? His "body" if he has one?

**Atmosphere:** Unknown. Those who enter don't describe it. Those who try to enter without authorization don't come back, or come back... different.

### Levels 5-6: The Deep (Forbidden)

No one goes to Level 5. No one goes to Level 6. The access points are sealed, welded, marked with symbols that don't correspond to any human warning system.

Frugowski's journals mention Level 6 exactly once:

> *"The bottom level is where I put the things that couldn't be destroyed but couldn't be allowed to exist on the surface. The original Incident samples. The first Signal recordings—raw, unfiltered, before we learned to dampen them. The things that whisper back when you whisper to them."*

> *"I go down there sometimes. To remember. To apologize. To make sure the seals are holding."*

> *"If you're reading this after I'm gone: don't go to Level 6. Whatever's down there has been waiting a long time. Let it keep waiting."*

---

## Social Function

Terminal 7-B isn't just a facility. It's **where people gather**. The closest thing Degenora has to a town square, a tavern, a community center.

### Daily Life

**Morning:** The night shift returns from field observation. They trade stories, PILLS, warnings about specimen activity. The Marketplace opens. Kermit wakes up (does he sleep? unclear) and starts his day with his first cigarette of approximately two hundred.

**Midday:** Peak activity. New arrivals processed. Quests assigned. Information flows freely—or flows in exchange for PILLS, depending on who you're talking to.

**Evening:** The social peak. Groups form for expeditions. Veterans mentor newcomers. Rumors circulate about Signal surges, Void expansions, strange occurrences in the deep sectors.

**Night:** Quieter, but never empty. The Terminal never closes. Some Observers prefer night—less crowded, more intimate, easier to hear the quiet sounds that might be the Signal trying to communicate.

### Culture

Terminal 7-B has developed its own customs:

- **The First PILLS Ritual:** New Observers spend their first earnings immediately, usually on information from Kermit. It's considered bad luck to save your first PILLS.
- **Absentee Stories:** Veterans compete to tell the strangest tales of what their shadow selves did while they were away. Some are true. All are instructive.
- **The Green Toast:** Raising a glass (of whatever beverage the recyclers have produced) toward Green Pond, acknowledging the Deep Dwellers who make the PILLS possible.
- **Frugowski's Seat:** A stool at the edge of Kermit's Nook, always empty. No one sits there. No one questions why.

### Conflicts

Not all is harmonious. Terminal 7-B has factions:

- **The Archivists:** Believe in systematic documentation. The island can be understood through careful study. They dominate Level 3.
- **The Traders:** Focus on the PILLS economy. Everything has a price. Everything can be traded. They dominate Level 1.
- **The Seekers:** Obsessed with the Signal, the Void, the mysteries. Risk-takers. Often found trying to sneak toward the lower levels.
- **The Survivors:** Just want to stay alive. Stick to safe sectors. Accumulate PILLS slowly. Don't ask questions.

Kermit facilitates all factions, favors none. FRUG tracks their interactions, learns from their conflicts. The Terminal is an ecosystem, and like all ecosystems, it thrives on tension.

---

## The Signal Connection

Terminal 7-B is the **primary reception point** for the Signal on Degenora. Not the only point—the island is saturated with it—but the strongest, the clearest, the most concentrated.

This is why it was built here. Frugowski recognized early that the Signal's intensity varied by location, and this spot—Sector Zero, Grid 7-B—was a nexus. A place where the broadcast came through with minimal distortion.

The implications:

1. **Communication:** Messages from the Signal, when they come, arrive here first. Kermit interprets. FRUG records. The Terminal becomes the island's ear.

2. **Corruption:** Extended exposure to strong Signal has... effects. Terminal 7-B staff (the few humans who live here permanently) report vivid dreams, time slips, occasional knowledge of things they shouldn't know. The trade-off for being at the center.

3. **Attraction:** The specimens know. Bog Hoppers gather at the Terminal's surface vents, singing their strange harmonics. Shadow Stalkers watch from the forest edge, waiting for someone to venture too far alone. The Terminal is a beacon, and beacons attract attention.

> *"Living at 7-B is like living at the bottom of a waterfall. The Signal just... pours down on you. Constantly. You get used to it. You have to. But sometimes I wonder what I'm missing. What thoughts are mine and what are just... echoes."* — Terminal Operator, anonymous interview

---

## Security & Clearance

The Terminal operates on a **tiered clearance system** managed by FRUG:

| Level | Access | Requirements |
|-------|--------|--------------|
| **Public** | Levels 1-2 | Registration as Observer |
| **Restricted** | Level 3 | 100+ documented specimens, 30+ days active |
| **Classified** | Level 4 | Invitation only, criteria undisclosed |
| **Forbidden** | Levels 5-6 | No human access authorized |

Physical security is minimal—FRUG monitors, Kermit watches, but there's no armed guard, no biometric lock (except on the lower levels). The assumption seems to be that the island itself protects the Terminal. Or that the things worth protecting are protected by being... unapproachable.

---

## Notable Events

**The Surge of Year 8:** A Signal amplification event caused Terminal 7-B's systems to operate at 400% normal capacity for 72 hours. Observers reported spontaneous knowledge downloads—waking up knowing things they hadn't learned. Kermit was uncharacteristically silent for three days afterward. When he resumed speaking, he asked questions about "the other place" that no one understood.

**The Breach of Year 11:** Something penetrated Level 4. Never identified. Never caught. But for six hours, the Terminal was in lockdown, and when it reopened, one of the research labs had been... rearranged. Equipment organized in patterns. Data organized by criteria no human had programmed. FRUG claimed ignorance. Kermit claimed ignorance. The consensus: something came up from below, looked around, tidied up, left.

**The Visitor of Year 14:** A human figure appeared in the Marketplace. Looked like Frugowski, older, worn. Spoke to no one. Walked to Level 3, entered the Archive, emerged two hours later. Disappeared in the Swamp. No record of what they accessed. Kermit refuses to discuss it. The official log: "Maintenance drone malfunction. Disregard."

---

## Current Status

Terminal 7-B remains **operational and essential** to life on Degenora. It's the one place on the island where humans have built something that persists—imperfect, strange, sometimes threatening, but *theirs*.

Recent developments:
- **Population growth:** More Observers arriving every month. The Commons gets crowded. Expansion discussions (always vetoed by Kermit—"the Terminal is the size it needs to be")
- **Signal stability:** Unusual period of calm. No surges for 200+ days. Some worry this means a big one is coming.
- **Lower level activity:** Sensors on Level 4 detect movement. FRUG marks it "routine maintenance." No maintenance is scheduled.
- **Kermit's behavior:** Increasingly cryptic. More references to "the old man" (Frugowski?). More PILLS given away for free, always with warnings attached.

> *"Terminal 7-B isn't a place. It's a process. A conversation between human intention and island response. We build walls. The Signal seeps through. We install lights. The shadows learn to dance. We're not winning. We're not losing. We're just... continuing. Which, on Degenora, is the only victory available."* — Kermit, rare philosophical moment
