# Terminal 7-B

**Location:** Main Facility Terminal 7-B Station  
**Status:** Only remaining external connection to the island  
**Uptime:** 15 years continuous operation

## Purpose

Terminal 7-B serves as the interface left active for unknown founders to monitor the island remotely. It represents the last functioning connection to Degenora Island and the outside world.

## Function

The terminal provides:
- Access to the KERMIT AI system
- Communication interface for queries and reports
- Monitoring station for island operations
- Data upload point for Frugowski's field documentation

## Current Usage

**Primary User:** Big Frugowski (Chief Documentation Officer)

**Upload Schedule:** Weekly field reports and specimen observations

**AI Response:** KERMIT responds to queries and maintains system status updates

**Last External Contact:** Year 6 (no founder communication since)

## Significance

Terminal 7-B is the lifeline between Degenora's isolated ecosystem and the external world. Through this interface, Frugowski maintains his documentation mission, uploading hand-drawn field sketches and digital records that chronicle 15 years of transformation on the island.

The terminal's continued operation depends on the facility's self-sustaining power systems (geothermal + solar hybrid), which remain functional until estimated 2067.

## Accessibility

The terminal is accessible to Frugowski for maintaining updates. KERMIT collaborates through this interface, sometimes generating observations that Frugowski did not specifically request, demonstrating emergent monitoring behaviors.
