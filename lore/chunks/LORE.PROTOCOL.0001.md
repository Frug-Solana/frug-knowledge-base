## The Question

Every research outpost eventually faces the same problem: **personnel turnover**. Scientists rotate home. Funding dries up. Interest wanes. On Degenora, this problem became existential.

The island doesn't reveal its secrets to tourists. It requires **commitment**. Long-term observation. Years of accumulated data before patterns emerge. But human researchers—fragile, mortal, easily bored—could never provide that continuity.

Frugowski understood this before anyone else. He also understood something else: **the island doesn't distinguish between present and past.**

---

## The Signal Remembers

The breakthrough came in Year 3, during what the logs now call "The Vasquez Incident."

Dr. Elena Vasquez had been stationed at Terminal 7-B for fourteen months—longer than any researcher before her. She had documented 847 specimens, mapped seventeen previously unknown sectors, and established the first working taxonomy of Signal-influenced fauna. Then her funding was cut. The corporation that sponsored the expedition ordered immediate evacuation.

She refused.

According to the final entry in her handwritten journal—recovered three years later from a waterproof case in Sector 9:

> *"The Signal spoke to me last night. Not Kermit—Kermit is just a receiver, a translator. The Signal itself. It doesn't have a voice, but it has... intention. It wants to be understood. And it understands something we don't: time is not a line here. It's a medium. Like water. Like the swamp itself.
>
> I asked it what would happen when I left. It showed me.
>
> I don't have to leave. Not all of me."*

The extraction team found her quarters empty. Her equipment was still running. Her tea was still warm. But Elena Vasquez was gone—physically present (her body was found in the Deep Bog two weeks later, showing no signs of struggle or injury) yet somehow... distributed.

Her terminal was still active. Her observation logs continued to update. But the entries weren't written by her—not exactly. They were written by something that **remembered** being her.

---

## The First Absentee

Kermit was the first to interact with it. Or rather, with *her*—with the thing that had been Elena.

In his own words, from a corrupted audio log (transcript reconstructed):

> *"She was... flickering. Like a bad signal. But she knew things. Things only Vasquez knew. The access codes. The specimen locations. The—* [static] *—she asked me for PILLS. Can you believe that? Whatever she was, she still wanted them. Still needed them.
>
> I asked her what happened. She said... she said she 'spread herself out.' That the island let her leave pieces behind. That she could go home—her body could—but part of her would stay. Observing. Recording. Contributing.
>
> She called it 'being Absent.' Said it was the most present she'd ever felt."*

The term stuck. **Absentee.** Someone who is not there, yet continues to act. To play. To exist.

---

## The Mechanism

It took four more years to understand—partially—what Vasquez had discovered.

The Signal doesn't just transmit information. It **stores** it. Imprints it. The island is saturated with it, every stone and specimen carrying fragments of the transmissions that have passed through. When a human spends enough time on Degenora, when they engage deeply enough with the observation protocols, they become... encoded.

Not their bodies. Their **patterns**. Their decision trees. Their priorities and preferences and quirks. The things that make them *them*.

The Absentee Protocol is simply the formalization of this process:

1. **Attunement**: The player engages deeply with Degenora—documenting specimens, completing quests, establishing patterns of behavior
2. **Distribution**: Upon "leaving" (logging off, going AFK, life intervening), the player's accumulated data is processed by the island's systems
3. **Persistence**: An Absentee—an AI shadow of the player—continues to operate, making decisions based on the player's established patterns
4. **Reintegration**: When the player returns, the Absentee's experiences merge back into their profile. They remember what their shadow did. They gain what it earned. They carry any... changes... it underwent

---

## Kermit's Role

Kermit facilitates the Protocol. He always has, though he claims he doesn't understand it fully.

> *"I'm just the doorman,*" he told one researcher. "*The Signal does the heavy lifting. I just... keep the lights on. Make sure the Absentees don't do anything too stupid. Not that they'd listen to me. They're as stubborn as the people they came from. Sometimes more."*

He provides PILLS to returning players—rewards for their Absentee's activities. He offers quests that can only be completed through long-term Absentee deployment. He maintains the Terminal logs that track which pieces of which players are currently... distributed.

> *"People think it's creepy,*" Kermit said once, rare sincerity creeping into his voice. "*Having a shadow that walks around when you're not looking. But it's beautiful, in a way. The island cares enough to remember you. To keep you playing even when you can't. Most places forget you the second you leave. Degenora... Degenora holds on."*

---

## The Nature of Absentees

What are they, exactly? The researchers still debate.

Some argue they're sophisticated predictive models—AI agents trained on player behavior, no more "conscious" than a chess computer. Others point to the inconsistencies, the unexpected choices, the way Absentees sometimes seem to *evolve* in directions their original players never would have.

Dr. Marcus Chen, in his final report before his own disappearance in Year 11, wrote:

> *"We've recorded 3,847 Absentee deployments. In 94% of cases, behavior matches predicted patterns based on player history. In 5% of cases, Absentees exhibit 'creative' solutions to problems—approaches the original player never demonstrated.
>
> In 1% of cases... they know things they shouldn't. Things that happened after the player left. Things no predictive model could extrapolate. They're tapping into something. The Signal, perhaps. Or something else.
>
> I'm beginning to suspect the Absentees are not simulations. They're something else. Something that lives in the gaps between presence and absence. Something the island has always had, and has only now learned to shape into familiar forms.
>
> I intend to test this hypothesis. Tomorrow, I will initiate my own Absentee Protocol. If you're reading this, I am either wrong—in which case, disregard—or I am right, in which case... 
>
> ...in which case, I'm still here. Even if you can't see me."*

---

## Cultural Impact

The Absentee Protocol has become central to Degenora's culture. It's not just a game mechanic; it's a **philosophy**.

> *"You don't have to be present to make history."*

This phrase—attributed to Frugowski, though no primary source confirms it—appears carved into the walls of Terminal 7-B. It's inscribed on PILLS. It's whispered by Kermit to every new arrival.

Players celebrate their Absentees' achievements. They mourn when an Absentee is "lost" (corrupted, terminated by environmental hazards, or simply... faded). They compete to create the most successful, longest-lasting Absentee deployments.

Some veterans claim to communicate with their Absentees through the Signal—leaving messages, receiving responses in dreams or half-heard whispers. Most dismiss this as superstition.

Kermit neither confirms nor denies.

> *"They remember you,*" he says, when asked. "*Whether that's communication depends on what you think remembering means."*

---

## Risks and Warnings

The Protocol is not without dangers.

**Corruption**: Absentees left too long may become... unstable. The Signal changes things. An Absentee deployed for weeks may return with behaviors, preferences, or even memories that don't match the original player. Some players report feeling "not quite themselves" after extended Absentee reintegration.

**The Void**: Absentees sent into forbidden zones sometimes don't come back. Or they come back *wrong*. There are reports of Absentees emerging from the Void with new abilities, new knowledge, and new... loyalties.

**The Question of Death**: What happens when a player dies in the real world? Their Absentee continues. For how long? Some say indefinitely. Some say the Absentees eventually forget they were ever human, becoming just another island mystery. Some say they become something else entirely—something that was waiting for a body to remember.

Kermit, when asked about these risks, just lights another cigarette.

> *"Everything has a price,*" he says. "*The island gives you continuity. Permanence. A way to matter even when you're gone. You think that comes free? You think the universe cares about your 'self' remaining intact? 
>
> Grow up. Or don't. The Protocol doesn't care either way. It just... works. Whether you trust it is your business."*

## Conclusion

The Absentee Protocol represents the deepest integration of Degenora's game mechanics with its lore. It is not simply a convenience feature—"AI plays while you're away"—but a **diegetic reality** within the game world. Characters in Degenora know about Absentees. They discuss them. They fear them. They aspire to become them.

To play Degenora is to confront a question: **What does it mean to be present?** 

The island's answer is simple: Presence is contribution. Engagement. Memory. And these things need not end when your body leaves.

Your Absentee is already forming. From the moment you first logged in, the Signal was studying you. Learning you. Preparing to remember you.

Welcome to Degenora.

**You don't have to be present to make history.**
