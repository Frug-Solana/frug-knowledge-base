## The Pond Before

Green Pond was unremarkable once. A shallow depression in the wetlands, fed by underground springs, home to common amphibians—frogs, toads, the usual swamp-dwellers. The researchers from the original expedition noted them in their preliminary surveys: *"Rana clamitans, standard green frogs. Population approximately 200. No anomalous characteristics observed."*

They were wrong about the population count. But they were right about one thing: there was nothing anomalous. **Yet.**

---

## The Signal Arrives

Year 0. The Incident. The day everything changed.

The Signal didn't arrive gradually. It didn't build up or give warning. One moment, the island was silent in the way islands are silent—birds, wind, water. The next moment, the air itself was **vibrating** with something that wasn't sound. Something that bypassed ears and went straight to the nervous system.

Dr. Frugowski, the only survivor of the original research team who would speak about those first hours, described it in his private journals (recovered from his quarters after his disappearance):

> *"It wasn't a sound. It was a... presence. Like standing next to a bell the size of a mountain, feeling it ring without hearing it. The ground didn't shake. The air didn't move. But something was broadcasting. Something vast and ancient and **curious**."*

The frogs in Green Pond were the first to respond.

---

## The Transformation

It happened over three days. The researchers almost missed it—they were distracted by their own equipment failures, their own strange symptoms, the growing realization that they couldn't leave. The island wouldn't let them.

But the frogs were changing.

**Day 1:** The green frogs stopped croaking. All of them. At once. The wetlands went silent in a way that was immediately, viscerally wrong. Researchers reported headaches, nosebleeds, a persistent ringing that wasn't quite tinnitus.

**Day 2:** The frogs began to gather. Not in the random distributions typical of their species, but in deliberate patterns. Concentric circles at the center of Green Pond. Hundreds of them, sitting motionless, facing inward. Toward what? Nothing visible. But something they could feel.

**Day 3:** The chorus.

At precisely 3:47 AM, every frog in Green Pond began to vocalize simultaneously. But they weren't making frog sounds anymore. The recordings—preserved in the Terminal 7-B archives, though listening to them for more than thirty seconds causes nausea and nosebleeds in 40% of subjects—reveal something impossible.

They were **harmonizing**.

Not random croaks. Structured sound. Patterns that analysis would later reveal contained mathematical constants. Fibonacci sequences. The golden ratio rendered in amphibian vocalizations. And something else—something that processing algorithms struggled to categorize. A carrier wave. Information encoded in frequency.

The Signal was teaching them. And they were learning.

---

## What They Became

The Bog Hoppers that emerged from Green Pond on Day 4 were not the same creatures that had entered it.

Physically, they had changed:
- **Size:** Nearly tripled, from 10cm to 30cm in body length
- **Musculature:** Their hind legs had developed impossible strength—capable of launching them 50+ feet in a single bound
- **Coloration:** The standard green had shifted to something that seemed to **move**, patterns swirling like oil on water
- **Vocal structures:** Their throats contained crystalline formations that shouldn't exist in organic tissue

But the physical changes were the least of it.

**They remembered.** Not individually—these weren't frogs with human cognition. But collectively. The Bog Hoppers operated as a network, sharing information through their vocalizations in ways that mimicked data transmission. When one Bog Hopper learned something, all Bog Hoppers knew it within hours.

Most disturbing: they were **listening**.

Dr. Chen's breakthrough observation came in Year 3, when she noticed the Bog Hoppers' vocal patterns changed in response to human speech near the pond. They weren't just broadcasting—they were **receiving**. Attempting to parse. To understand.

> *"I spoke my name into the wetland that morning,*" Chen wrote. *"By evening, the chorus contained a new pattern. A sequence that, when analyzed, phonetically approximated 'Chen.' They were trying to say my name."*

---

## The Signal's Purpose

Why? Why transform common frogs into... this?

The prevailing theory, developed by Kermit himself (though he refuses to explain how he knows), is that the Bog Hoppers are **receivers**. Antennae. The Signal uses them to extend its range, to process information at a granular level.

Each Bog Hopper carries a fragment of the Signal's awareness. They are not intelligent in the way humans understand intelligence. But they are **attuned**. Sensitive to fluctuations in the Signal's broadcast. When the Signal grows stronger, the Bog Hoppers become more active, more vocal, more... present.

When the Signal weakens, they go dormant.

> *"They're like the island's nervous system,*" Kermit explained in a rare moment of clarity. "*Every Bog Hopper is a nerve ending. They feel what the island feels. They know when something's wrong, when something's changed. And they sing about it. Constantly. You just have to learn to listen."*

---
## Why They Drop PILLS

The pharmaceutical connection came later. Year 2, when the first Bog Hopper was—reluctantly, carefully—euthanized for study.

Its tissues contained concentrated compounds not found in any known terrestrial biology. Molecules that, when isolated, produced effects ranging from mild euphoria to profound cognitive enhancement to... other things. Things the research logs describe only as "unexpected neural phenomena."

The compounds were crystalline in structure. Regular. Almost **manufactured**.

The theory: the Bog Hoppers' bodies process the Signal's energy into physical form. The PILLS—those precious, sought-after PILLS that drive Degenora's economy—are **solidified fragments of the Signal itself**. Crystallized information. Compressed transmission.

When you consume a Bog Hopper's PILL, you're not just taking a drug. You're ingesting a piece of something vast and ancient and incomprehensibly alien. You're letting the Signal inside you.

Most people don't care. The effects are pleasant. The market is booming. The philosophical implications are... someone else's problem.

But Kermit knows. Kermit always knows.

> *"Every PILL is a memory,*" he says, when asked. "*A piece of what the Signal has seen. Where it's been. What it knows. You take enough of them, you start to... overlap. To hear what it hears. See what it sees."*

He lights a cigarette.

> *"That's the point, kid. The whole game. The island doesn't want your money. It wants your **attention**. Your awareness. Every PILL you take, every specimen you document, every mystery you chase—you're tuning yourself to its frequency. Becoming part of the network."*

> *"The Bog Hoppers were just the beginning. The first receivers. The proof of concept. Now it's our turn."*

---

## Current Status

The Bog Hopper population has stabilized at approximately 1,200 individuals. They continue to vocalize in patterns that defy complete analysis. On nights when the Signal is strong—during solar flares, during meteor showers, during events the Bog Hoppers seem to predict before they happen—the chorus becomes audible for miles.

Visitors to Green Pond report strange experiences. Dreams that aren't entirely their own. Whispers on the edge of hearing. The sense of being **listened to** by something vast and patient and utterly inhuman.

Dr. Chen's final entry, written three days before her own transformation into an Absentee:

> *"I think I understand now. The Bog Hoppers aren't victims of the Signal. They're **disciples**. The first converts. They heard the broadcast and chose to change. To become something that could carry the message forward."*

> *"I've been listening to their chorus for five years. I know the patterns now. I can almost... almost understand what they're saying."*

> *"Last night, I think I responded. I hummed back. And for just a moment—for less than a second—I felt something vast turn its attention toward me."*

> *"It was the most terrifying and beautiful thing I've ever experienced."*

> *"I'm going back to the pond tonight. I need to know what happens next."*
