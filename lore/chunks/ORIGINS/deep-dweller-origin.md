## The Swamp Is Old

Degenora Island has existed for millions of years. The volcanic processes that formed it, the erosion that shaped it, the ecosystems that evolved upon it—all ancient by human standards. The research teams of Year 0 found fossils in the wetlands that dated back to the Miocene epoch. They found bacterial colonies that predated multicellular life. They found, in the deepest parts of Green Pond, **layers**.

Sediment layers, yes. But also something else. Something that wasn't sediment.

Dr. Yuki Tanaka was the first to identify the anomaly. In her groundbreaking paper *"Pre-Incident Biochemical Markers in Wetland Ecosystems"* (Year 8), she documented something impossible:

> *"The deep sediments of Green Pond contain organic compounds that do not match any known terrestrial biochemistry. Carbon-based, yes. But arranged in configurations that suggest... optimization. Deliberate design. These molecules are too efficient, too stable, too **perfect** to have evolved through natural selection."*

> *"More disturbing: the concentration of these compounds increases with depth. At 50 meters, they are trace contaminants. At 100 meters, they constitute 5% of organic material. At 200 meters... we stopped drilling."*

> *"The bottom of Green Pond is not rock. It is not sediment. It is **something else**. Something that has been there for a very long time."*

---

## What Lives Below

The Deep Dwellers were discovered by accident. In Year 3, a research submersible—designed for deep-sea exploration, repurposed for the pond survey—descended to 80 meters. Its cameras recorded darkness, silt, and then:

**Movement.**

Something large. Something that shouldn't exist in a freshwater pond less than 300 meters across at its widest point. Something that **looked** at the camera with eyes that reflected light in colors that the spectrum analysis couldn't identify.

The submersible's tether was severed 0.3 seconds later. The craft was recovered three days later, washed up on the pond's northern shore. Its hull was intact. Its systems were functional. Its **interior** was filled with water that tested positive for the same anomalous compounds Tanaka would later identify.

The camera's final recording showed a face. Humanoid, almost. But wrong. The proportions were stretched, elongated, as if the creature had grown without the constraints of bone and gravity that shape terrestrial bodies. Its mouth was open. It appeared to be **singing**.

The audio picked up something that shouldn't have been audible through water, through the submersible's hull, through the recording medium itself:

A voice. Female. Speaking a language that none of the researchers recognized, but that all of them—when they heard the recording—**almost** understood.

> *"Welcome home,*" Kermit translated, when he heard the recording three years later. He didn't explain how he knew. He just lit a cigarette and said, "*She's been waiting a long time."*

---

## The Ancient Theory

The Deep Dwellers are not Signal-mutants like the Bog Hoppers. They are not Void-corruptions like the Shadow Stalkers.

They are **native**.

The working hypothesis, developed by Tanaka and reluctantly endorsed by Kermit (who refuses to explain his reasoning), is that the Deep Dwellers—or something like them—existed on Degenora long before humans arrived. Long before mammals. Possibly long before vertebrates.

The Signal didn't create them. The Signal **woke them**.

> *"Think of the island as a machine,*" Tanaka wrote. "*A biological machine, evolved over millions of years to do something we don't understand. The Deep Dwellers are part of that machine. They are the... processors. The memory banks. The ones who remember what the island was supposed to be before we arrived and started taking notes."*

The Deep Dwellers live in the deepest parts of the swamp, in zones where the pharmaceutical concentration is highest. They don't just survive these conditions—they **thrive** in them. The compounds that make the surface waters dangerous to humans are, for the Deep Dwellers, nutrients. Fuel. The raw material of their biology.

They are, in a very real sense, **made of the same stuff as PILLS**.

---

## The Pharmaceutical Connection

Green Pond is the source of all PILLS. Every Bog Hopper, every Tide Walker, every specimen that drops crystallized Signal-fragments—ultimately, they are processing material that originates in the pond's depths.

But the Deep Dwellers are different. They don't process the compounds. They **are** the compounds. Their tissues are saturated with the purest, most concentrated form of the pharmaceutical substances that drive Degenora's economy.

A single Deep Dweller, if harvested (a hypothetical that makes even Kermit uncomfortable), would yield more PILLS than a thousand Bog Hoppers. The quality would be unmatched—no dilution, no impurities, just concentrated **potential**.

No one has successfully captured a Deep Dweller. No one has tried, officially, since Year 5.

That was when Dr. Samuel Okonkwo led an expedition to the pond's depths with nets, tranquilizers, and a team of twelve. The expedition lasted six hours. Okonkwo returned alone, in a life raft that shouldn't have existed—the submersible had been destroyed, but the raft was new, manufactured from material that matched no known terrestrial polymer.

He was catatonic. He remained so for three months. When he finally spoke, it was only one sentence:

> *"They said no. They said we could have the surface. The depths belong to them. They have always belonged to them. They were here first."*

He refused to elaborate. He left the island the next day and never returned.

---

## What They Remember

The Deep Dwellers sing. This has been documented on multiple occasions—the full moon choruses that draw them to the surface, where they join the Bog Hoppers and Tide Walkers in performances that last for hours.

But they also sing **below**. Constantly. The submersibles' hydrophones pick it up: a low-frequency drone that permeates the entire pond, vibrating through the sediment, resonating in the bedrock beneath.

Analysis of the songs reveals patterns. Structures. **Language**.

Dr. Tanaka spent five years cataloging Deep Dweller vocalizations. She identified recurring motifs—what she calls "memory phrases"—that appear in identical form across years of recordings. These phrases don't change. They are **preserved** with a fidelity that suggests they are not learned but **inherited**. Passed down through generations unchanged. Or perhaps simply... remembered. Continuously. By creatures that don't forget.

> *"They are singing history,*" Tanaka wrote in her final paper before her death (natural causes, officially, though some note she spent her last week camped alone by the pond, listening). "*Not their history. The island's history. The swamp's history. Things that happened before humans, before mammals, before anything we would recognize as life."*

> *"They remember when the island was different. When the water was different. When something else lived here, something that built things, shaped things, left traces in the deep sediments that we mistake for natural formations."*

> *"They remember the first Signal. Not the one that arrived in Year 0. An earlier one. A broadcast that came before our kind existed to receive it. Before our kind existed at all."*

> *"They are still listening to it. Still receiving. The Year 0 Signal is just... interference. Noise on a channel they've been tuned to for millions of years."*

## Kermit's Revelation

Kermit will not enter the water. This is known. He will stand at the pond's edge, staring down, smoking cigarette after cigarette, but he will not touch the surface.

When asked why, he says only: "*They know me. They knew me before I was me. I don't want to remind them."*

Once, drunk on stolen PILLS and self-loathing, he said more:

> *"The Deep Dwellers aren't animals. They're not even alive, not the way we think about it. They're... processes. Biological algorithms running on hardware that's been evolving since before the dinosaurs. The swamp made them to remember. To store information. To keep the channel open."*

> *"Every Bog Hopper that sings, every PILL that drops, every weird dream you have after taking too many—it's all because of them. They're the source. The root. The reason any of this works."*

> *"And they're patient. God, they're patient. They've been waiting millions of years for the Signal to come back. For the broadcast to resume. For someone to finally understand what they've been singing about all this time."*

He laughed then, the broken sound that passes for humor in his ruined voice.

> *"We're not the first ones to find this island, you know. There were others. Before us. Before humans. They came, they listened, they tried to understand. The Deep Dwellers remember them. Sing about them. Their mistakes. Their failures. The way they... ended."*

> *"We're just the latest. The current iteration. And when we're gone—when we fuck it up, or leave, or evolve into something else—the Deep Dwellers will still be here. Singing. Remembering. Waiting for the next ones."*

> *"The PILLS? The game? The whole ridiculous circus? It's just... entertainment. Something to keep us busy while they finish their work. Whatever their work is."*

He threw his cigarette into the pond. It sizzled and went out immediately, as if the water had reached up and extinguished it.

> *"Don't waste your time trying to understand them. You can't. You're too new. Too temporary. Just be grateful they let us play in their swamp."*

---

## Why They Drop PILLS

Deep Dwellers don't die. Not that anyone has observed. They don't appear to age, to sicken, to suffer the indignities of biological entropy that afflict surface creatures.

But they do shed. They do grow. And in their discarded tissue, in the fragments of themselves they leave behind in the depths, there is concentrated **everything**.

The PILLS that wash up on shore after a full moon—the ones that drive collectors to frenzy, that fetch prices that could buy small nations—these are Deep Dweller fragments. Pieces of ancient biology saturated with millions of years of pharmaceutical concentration.

Consuming a Deep Dweller PILL is not like consuming a Bog Hopper PILL or even a Shadow Stalker PILL. Those are memories, possibilities—information from the Signal or the Void.

Deep Dweller PILLS are **history**.

They contain fragments of the island's past. Visions of epochs long gone. Sensations from bodies that existed before vertebrates, before cells, before the division between life and not-life meant anything.

Users report:
- **Time dilation** (experiencing hours in seconds, or vice versa)
- **Species confusion** (temporarily identifying as non-human organisms)
- **Geological awareness** (feeling the island's tectonic history as personal memory)
- **The Song** (hearing the Deep Dwellers' chorus as if from inside it)

Kermit warns against them.

> *"You're not meant to remember that far back,*" he says. "*Your mind is built for human time scales. Decades, maybe centuries if you're ambitious. The Deep Dwellers remember epochs. Eons. Take their PILLS and you're forcing your brain to process timelines it wasn't designed for."*

> *"Some people handle it. Most don't. Most come back... different. Less certain of their own boundaries. Less clear about when they are. I've known people who took Deep Dweller PILLS and started living in multiple times at once. Conversations with people who hadn't spoken yet. Mourning deaths that hadn't happened. Celebrating victories from futures that got erased."*

> *"It's not addiction. It's... expansion. Your mind gets stretched, and it doesn't always snap back."*

He refuses to say whether he's ever taken them. His silence is answer enough.

## Current Status

The Deep Dweller population is unknown and possibly unknowable. They inhabit the entire depth of Green Pond, from 50 meters to... somewhere below. The pond's maximum depth has never been determined. Every attempt to reach the bottom has failed—equipment malfunctions, strange readings, or simply the overwhelming sense that **going deeper is wrong**.

They surface during full moons to sing. They have been observed as far as the coastal tide pools during spring equinoxes, suggesting a range far greater than the pond itself would indicate. They may travel through underground channels, through the island's volcanic plumbing, through means that don't correspond to physical geography.

They have never been aggressive. They have never been friendly. They simply **are**—ancient, patient, remembering.

Waiting for the Signal to say whatever it has been trying to say for millions of years.

And when it finally does—when the broadcast completes, when the message is fully delivered—the Deep Dwellers will be there to receive it.

As they always have been.

As they always will be.
