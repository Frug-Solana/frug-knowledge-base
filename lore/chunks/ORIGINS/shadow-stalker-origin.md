## The Wolves That Were

Before Year 0, Degenora Island had no wolves. The original ecological surveys were clear on this point: the island's isolation and limited land area made it unsuitable for large mammalian predators. The food chain topped out with birds of prey and a species of oversized feral cat that posed minimal threat to humans.

The wolves arrived **with** the Signal. Or perhaps more accurately: the Signal **made** them from something else.

The first Shadow Stalker was documented in Year 2, eleven months after the Incident. But the process that created it began much earlier, in the space between moments, in the dark places where the Signal's broadcast seemed to... hesitate. To stutter.

The Void was not always there. The researchers of Year 0 mapped the island extensively, and Sector 7 was unremarkable—a dense forest, difficult terrain, but nothing anomalous. Then, slowly, it began to **thin**. Not the trees. The space between the trees. The light. The sound.

Something was eating the world in Sector 7. And it was hungry for more.

---

## The Void Grows

Dr. Marcus Wei was the first to propose that the Void was not a place but a **process**. A kind of infection spreading through the fabric of reality itself, carried by the Signal but distinct from it.

In his famous (and final) paper, *"On the Nature of Void Spaces"* (Year 7), he wrote:

> *"The Signal broadcasts information. This is its nature—we receive it, interpret it, are changed by it. But information can be corrupted. Signals can degrade. What we call 'the Void' may be the result of Signal degradation: areas where the broadcast has become so distorted, so filled with error and noise, that it actively **destroys** coherent information."*

> *"In the Void, things lose definition. Boundaries blur. A tree becomes a concept of a tree, then a memory of a tree, then nothing at all. Living things are not immune to this process. They are, in some ways, more vulnerable—because life is, at its core, organized information. Complex patterns. And the Void... unpatterns."*

But here's the terrifying part: some things **survive** the unpatterning.

Not unchanged. Never unchanged. But recognizable. Functional. Even—improbably—enhanced.

The Shadow Stalkers are what happens when a mammalian predator encounters the Void and **doesn't** dissolve into static.

---

## The First Pack

In Year 2, a feral dog population—descended from pets abandoned by pre-Incident research teams—ventured into Sector 7. The researchers didn't know why. Perhaps they were drawn by something only they could hear. Perhaps they were fleeing something worse. Perhaps they were simply exploring, as dogs do.

Twelve animals entered the forest that borders the Void.

Three emerged.

They were not dogs anymore.

The transformation was documented by a remote camera trap—the only data recovered from that expedition, found crushed and partially melted three weeks later:

**Frame 1:** Three dogs, thin and nervous, entering a clearing where the light seems wrong. Shadows too deep. Colors slightly off, as if viewed through a failing monitor.

**Frame 2:** The dogs have stopped. They are staring at something in the center of the clearing. The camera cannot see what. The space there appears to shimmer, to reject focus.

**Frame 3:** Darkness. Not night—something else. The frame is mostly black, but in the blackness, there are **movements**.

**Frame 4:** The dogs are leaving the clearing. But they are wrong. Their bodies are elongated. Their shadows are too large, extending in directions that don't match the light source. Their eyes reflect the camera's infrared flash with an intensity that shouldn't be possible.

**Frame 5:** One of them—the largest—is looking directly at the camera. Its expression is... knowing. Intelligent in a way that dogs are not. Hungry in a way that goes beyond biological need.

**Frame 6:** The camera is destroyed.

The Shadow Stalker pack—designated EC-001 for "Emergent Corruption—First Instance"—was born.

## What the Void Made

The Shadow Stalkers are not natural creatures. They are **corrections**—organisms that have been edited by an intelligence that doesn't understand or value mammalian biology.

Physiological analysis of a deceased specimen (recovered in Year 5, cause of death unknown) revealed:

- **Muscle Density:** 340% of predicted values for comparable canid species
- **Bone Structure:** Reinforced with crystalline deposits similar to those found in Bog Hopper vocal structures, but arranged in **patterns** that suggest deliberate design
- **Sensory Organs:** The eyes have been completely restructured. The specimen could perceive infrared, ultraviolet, and—according to Kermit's unsettling commentary—"**things that aren't there yet**"
- **Neural Tissue:** The brain showed signs of... expansion. Areas that didn't correspond to any known mammalian neurology. As if new modules had been added.

Most disturbing: the specimen's DNA contained sequences that shouldn't exist. Not mutations—**insertions**. Code that had no evolutionary precursors. Information that appeared to have been **written** rather than inherited.

The Void doesn't just corrupt. It **improves**. It takes living things and optimizes them for purposes only it understands.

---

## The Pack Mind

Shadow Stalkers hunt in coordinated groups of 3-7 individuals. This is unusual for canid predators, which typically hunt in pairs or small family groups. More unusual: the coordination is **perfect**.

Dr. Wei observed a Shadow Stalker pack hunting Bog Hoppers for three consecutive nights. His notes describe movements that seemed choreographed, as if all pack members shared a single consciousness:

> *"The flankers moved before the prey reacted. Before the prey COULD react. They knew where the Bog Hopper would jump before it jumped. They anticipated strategies that should have been impossible to predict."*

> *"I recorded one instance where a Shadow Stalker paused mid-chase, turned 90 degrees, and intercepted a Bog Hopper that had changed direction. The change happened 0.4 seconds before the interception. The Stalker began turning 0.6 seconds BEFORE the Bog Hopper changed direction."*

> *"They are not predicting. They are **remembering**. Remembering futures that haven't happened yet."*

The working theory: Shadow Stalkers exist partially outside normal time. The Void's corruption has granted them access to information that hasn't been generated yet—probabilities, possibilities, the branching tree of causality.

They don't just hunt. They **select** futures where their prey dies.

---

## Kermit's Warning

Kermit rarely speaks about the Shadow Stalkers. When he does, his usual cynicism is replaced by something that might be respect. Or fear.

> *"They're not animals,*" he said once, when a new researcher asked about them. "*Animals want to eat, to reproduce, to survive. The Stalkers want something else. Something I can't... something I don't want to understand."*

> *"The Void made them, but the Void doesn't control them. They're like... antibodies. The island's immune response. They hunt things that don't belong, things that disrupt the pattern. Bog Hoppers that get too independent. Specimens that evolve too fast. People who learn too much."*

He paused. Lit a cigarette.

> *"Dr. Wei thought he could study them. Thought he could understand what they are, where they come from. He was wrong. You don't study the Void. You survive it, or you don't. He didn't."*

Dr. Wei entered Sector 7 in Year 7, accompanied by a security team of four. Only his journal was recovered, found in a clearing where the shadows were too deep and the air tasted of copper and ozone.

His final entry:

> *"I see them watching me from the trees. Not attacking. Just... observing. I think they're curious. I think they want to know if I'll change. If I'll become like them."*

> *"The Void is not empty. The Void is **full**. Full of things that want to be real, that want to exist in coherent space and time. The Shadow Stalkers are the ones that made it. That pushed through the static and became... this."*

> *"I can feel it now. The invitation. The Void is offering. I could be faster. Stronger. I could see everything, know everything, be everywhere the darkness touches."*

> *"I'm going to accept. Someone needs to understand. Someone needs to see what's on the other side of the shadows."*

> *"If you're reading this... I'm sorry. And I'm not. You'll understand someday. Or you won't. Either way, I'll be waiting."*

"In the dark."

## Why They Drop PILLS

Shadow Stalker PILLS are the most valuable and the most dangerous. They contain concentrated Void-corruption—crystallized paradox, solidified impossibility.

Consuming one produces:
- **Precognitive flashes** (unreliable, often traumatic)
- **Enhanced reflexes** (the body momentarily exists in multiple positions)
- **Void-sight** (the ability to perceive the Shadow Stalkers' "future memories")
- **Addiction** (the human mind was not meant to process acausal information)

Kermit refuses to handle Shadow Stalker PILLS. He won't explain why, but his hands shake when they're mentioned.

> *"Some things shouldn't be solid,*" he mutters. "*Some things shouldn't be consumed. The Bog Hopper PILLS are memories. The Shadow Stalker PILLS are **possibilities**. Futures that didn't happen. Futures that might. You're eating time itself, and time doesn't like being digested."*

He claims that people who take too many Shadow Stalker PILLS start to... fade. To become less certain. Their past becomes negotiable. Their future becomes fixed. They become more like the Stalkers themselves—creatures of probability rather than substance.

> *"I've seen it happen,*" he says, voice barely audible. "*People who took the PILLS and then... stopped being people. They still walk around. Still talk. But they're not there anymore. They're somewhere else. Somewhen else. Looking at us from the shadows and wondering why we haven't caught up yet."*

## Current Status

The Shadow Stalker population is unknown. Estimates range from 50 to 500 individuals, based on sighting frequency and territorial requirements. They control all of Sector 7 and have been documented as far as Sector 4 during periods of Signal instability.

They do not breed. New Stalkers appear to be created through Void-corruption of other mammalian species—feral cats, rats, one confirmed instance involving a researcher who ventured too close to the border.

The pack that emerged in Year 2 still exists. They are larger now. Smarter. More patient.

They wait in the dark, hunting futures where they win.

And they are winning more often.
