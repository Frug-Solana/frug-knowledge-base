# SPECIMEN DOSSIER #001
## Mycelia Synchronis
**Common Designation:** Signal-Resonant Fungus  
**Threat Level:** Minimal (2/10)  
**Classification:** Bioluminescent Fungi / Signal-Responsive Organism  
**Discovery:** Year 5, Field Researcher Vex, Zone A1

---

## VISUAL IDENTIFICATION

Signal-Resonant Fungus manifests as clustered caps (3-8cm diameter) atop fibrous stalks (5-12cm height). Key identifying features:

- **Bioluminescence:** Soft blue-green glow (wavelength ~495nm)
- **Pulsation:** Caps pulse in rhythmic synchronization with ambient Signal frequency
- **Cluster Pattern:** Grows in circular formations radiating from Signal emitters
- **Spore Cloud:** Releases faint luminescent spores when disturbed

> **Field Note:** "The glow is hypnotic. I've watched colonists stare at a cluster for hours, tracking the pulse. The Signal does something to the brain's pattern-recognition centers. Beautiful. Dangerous in its own way."  
> — Field Researcher Vex, Log 334

## BEHAVIORAL ANALYSIS

### Signal Synchronization
The organism's bioluminescent cycle perfectly matches background Signal frequency. KERMIT analysis confirms:

- Pulse interval: 4.7 seconds (matches Signal harmonic)
- Response delay: <0.003 seconds to Signal fluctuations
- Range: Synchronization occurs within 500m of active Signal emitters

### Nutritional Anomaly
Mycelia Synchronis does not consume organic matter. Metabolic analysis indicates:

- **Primary energy source:** Electromagnetic radiation (Signal-band frequencies)
- **Secondary absorption:** Ambient heat from ruins
- **Cultivation status:** IMPOSSIBLE outside Degenora's Signal influence

This explains why all transplantation attempts to off-island facilities have failed.

## HAZARD ASSESSMENT

### Direct Threat: MINIMAL
- No aggressive behavior
- Physical contact causes no injury
- Spore inhalation: Mild disorientation only

### Indirect Threat: MODERATE
- **Hallucinogenic Properties:** Consumption causes 2-hour hallucination state
- **Neural Effects:** Victims report "hearing" Signal whispers during episodes
- **Cult Usage:** Void Cultists deliberately ingest for "communion" rituals

### KERMIT Advisory
> "Colony medical logs show 94% of Signal-Resonant Fungus poisonings are intentional. The remaining 6% are children who didn't listen to safety briefings. Education remains more effective than prohibition."

## UTILIZATION NOTES

### Harvest Protocol
| Method | PILLS Yield | Risk Level |
|--------|-------------|------------|
| Safe Harvest (gloves, mask) | 5-10 | Negligible |
| Aggressive Harvest (uprooting) | 15-25 | Low (spore exposure) |
| First Discovery | 50 (one-time) | N/A |

### Alchemical Applications
- **Signal Attunement Potions:** Requires 3x dried caps
- **Neural Calibrants:** Spore extraction for research purposes
- **Trade Value:** 5 PILLS base to collectors

### WARNING
Raw consumption causes:
- 2-hour hallucination debuff
- -2 Perception for duration
- Vivid dreams of "Signal whispers" (reported by 78% of cases)

## ECOLOGICAL ROLE

Mycelia Synchronis serves as a **bio-indicator** for Signal intensity:

- **Dense clusters:** High Signal saturation zone
- **Sparse distribution:** Signal border regions
- **Dim luminescence:** Signal interference or corruption present

Experienced explorers use the fungus as natural navigation—follow the glow toward Signal sources, avoid where it fades unexpectedly.

## TERMINAL 7-B ARCHIVE NOTES

**First Recorded Sighting:** Year 5, Day 127  
**Documented By:** Field Researcher Vex  
**Current Distribution:** Zones A1, A2, B2 (expanding)  
**Population Trend:** INCREASING (correlates with Signal intensification)

> "The colonists call them 'ghost lights.' The scientists call them Mycelia Synchronis. I call them a warning system. When they start pulsing faster than 4.7 seconds, something's coming. The Signal is changing. The fungus feels it first."  
> — Big Frugowski, Terminal 7-B Observation Log
