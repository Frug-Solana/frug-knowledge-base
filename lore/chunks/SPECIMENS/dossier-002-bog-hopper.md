# SPECIMEN DOSSIER #002
## Ranidae Saltator
**Common Designation:** Bog Hopper  
**Threat Level:** Moderate (4/10)  
**Classification:** Amphibious Mutant / Pharmaceutical Contamination  
**Discovery:** Year 1, Month 2, Big Frugowski (FR-001)

---

## VISUAL IDENTIFICATION

Bog Hoppers are large amphibians with mutated physiology from baseline frog specimens. Key identifying features:

- **Size:** 0.8-1.2m body length, 30-50kg mass
- **Leg Structure:** Massively enlarged hind limbs (3x baseline) with reinforced tendons
- **Coloration:** 
  - B-12X (Green) variant: Mottled emerald with yellow striping
  - L-19 (Yellow) variant: Golden-amber with bioluminescent spots
- **Vocal Sacs:** Inflatable throat membranes for complex vocalization
- **Eyes:** Forward-facing with nictitating membranes for underwater vision

> **Field Note:** "First documented in Month 2. I thought it was a log until it jumped clean over my observation tower. Fifty feet. Straight up. Landed in the pond with a splash that soaked my equipment."  
> — Big Frugowski, First Contact Log

## BEHAVIORAL ANALYSIS

### Locomotion
Bog Hoppers exhibit extraordinary jumping capability:
- **Maximum Leap:** 50+ feet horizontal, 15+ feet vertical
- **Takeoff Velocity:** 12 m/s (calculated from trajectory analysis)
- **Landing Impact:** Can destabilize structures (caution near wooden platforms)

### Territorial Behavior
- **Solo hunters** except during mating season (Months 4-6)
- **Vocal Patrols:** Complex croaking patterns define territory boundaries
- **Warning Display:** Throat sac inflation before aggressive action
- **Retreat Threshold:** Will flee if opponent demonstrates superior jumping height

### Intelligence Markers
- Recognize individual researchers (demonstrated preference for Frugowski)
- Learn trap patterns within 3-5 exposures
- Coordinate hunting strategies (observed in L-19 variants)

## HAZARD ASSESSMENT

### Direct Threat: MODERATE
| Behavior | Risk Level | Mitigation |
|----------|------------|------------|
| Territory Defense | Moderate | Avoid marked zones during breeding season |
| Accidental Collision | Low-Moderate | Maintain situational awareness near water |
| Kick Strike | High (if landed) | Keep 15m clearance from launch points |

### Pharmaceutical Contamination
Bog Hoppers concentrate compounds from their diet:
- **Meat Quality:** Unfit for consumption (toxin accumulation)
- **PILLS Extraction:** Possible via specialized processing (10-15 PILLS per specimen)
- **Research Value:** High (pharmaceutical pathway studies)

### KERMIT Assessment
> "They jump because they can. The L-19 variant has calculated the exact trajectory to reach any point in their territory. I've seen them adjust mid-air for wind conditions. Remarkable. Unsettling. Don't stand on the lily pads."

## UTILIZATION NOTES

### Taming Protocol
| Phase | Duration | Success Rate |
|-------|----------|--------------|
| Acclimation | 5-7 days | 70% |
| Trust Building | 2-3 weeks | 45% |
| Mount Training | 1-2 months | 20% |
| Full Bond | 3+ months | 8% |

**Tamed Applications:**
- Rapid wetland traversal (mounted travel)
- High-ground reconnaissance (launch assist)
- Companion harvesting (follows to water sources)

### Combat Statistics (Tamed)
| Attribute | Value |
|-----------|-------|
| HP | 85 |
| Speed | 14 (ground) / 20 (jump) |
| Attack | 10 (kick) / 6 (tongue) |
| Defense | 6 |
| Special | Double Jump (evades ground attacks) |

## ECOLOGICAL ROLE

### Diet
**Primary Food Source:** Luminescent Larvae (SPECIMEN.DOSSIER.004)

This creates a **pharmaceutical concentration cycle:**
```
Larvae (absorb compounds from water)
    ↓
Bog Hoppers (concentrate via feeding)
    ↓
Predators (accumulate from Bog Hopper consumption)
```

### Population Dynamics
- **Current Estimate:** 1,000+ individuals
- **Growth Rate:** Stable (+2% annually)
- **Territory Expansion:** Gradual encroachment into Zone B2

## TERMINAL 7-B ARCHIVE NOTES

**First Recorded Sighting:** Year 1, Day 47  
**Documented By:** Big Frugowski (FR-001)  
**Current Distribution:** Wetlands, Green Pond, Zone A3, Zone B1  
**Population Trend:** STABLE

> "Year 15 update: The Bog Hoppers have learned to recognize the sound of my ATV engine. They go silent when I approach. Not fear—anticipation. They know I bring specimens to trade. There's something happening here. Evolution in real-time."
> — Big Frugowski, Terminal 7-B
