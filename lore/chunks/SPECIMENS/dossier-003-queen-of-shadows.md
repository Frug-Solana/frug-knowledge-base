# SPECIMEN DOSSIER #003
## Vulpes Sapiens
**Common Designation:** Queen of Shadows (Sable Fox)  
**Threat Level:** UNKNOWN / Context Dependent (7/10 potential)  
**Classification:** Cognitive-Enhanced Apex Predator / Unique Specimen  
**Discovery:** Year 1, Month 6, Big Frugowski (FR-003)

---

## VISUAL IDENTIFICATION

The Queen of Shadows is a unique specimen—no second individual has ever been documented. Physical characteristics:

- **Size:** 1.4m length (including tail), 35kg mass (2x baseline fox)
- **Coat:** Jet black fur with subtle iridescent undertones
- **Eyes:** Amber-gold with slit pupils; demonstrates prolonged eye contact behavior
- **Markings:** None (pure C-47 Red variant)
- **Movement:** Silent, calculated—no wasted energy

> **Discovery Report:** "Dusk. Motion sensor didn't trigger. But I SAW her. A fox. Jet black. Larger than baseline. Watching from exactly 40 feet away.
>
> I checked the sensor logs. She's been there before. Same spot. Same time. Every night for the past week. HOW DID SHE KNOW THE RANGE?"
> — Big Frugowski, FR-003

## BEHAVIORAL ANALYSIS

### Cognitive Enhancement Markers
The Queen demonstrates intelligence indicators unprecedented in non-primate fauna:

- **Sensor Avoidance:** Consistently maintains 40-foot distance from motion detectors
- **Pattern Recognition:** Studies human behavior, learns routines
- **Tool Awareness:** Recognizes and avoids traps after single exposure
- **Temporal Understanding:** Annual midnight visit to Frugowski's quarters (New Year's tradition)
- **Social Intelligence:** Demonstrates what appears to be mutual recognition with Frugowski

### Hunting Methodology
- **Observation Phase:** 1-7 days of silent surveillance
- **Strike Timing:** Exploits moments of distraction or routine
- **Killing Efficiency:** Single precise throat bite (observed on deer specimens)
- **Food Caching:** Hides excess kills in multiple locations (observed)

### Territorial Behavior
- **Range:** Approximately 8km radius from Observation House 04
- **Marking:** Rare—uses strategic scent placement only
- **Intruder Response:** Eliminates competing predators (3 wolf carcasses found, Year 3-8)

## HAZARD ASSESSMENT

### Direct Threat: UNKNOWN
The Queen has never attacked a human. Assessment based on capability:

| Capability | Threat Implication |
|------------|-------------------|
| Intelligence | Can anticipate and counter human tactics |
| Speed | 65+ km/h sprint capability estimated |
| Stealth | Undetectable by standard sensors |
| Patience | Will wait days/weeks for optimal conditions |

### KERMIT Assessment
> "The Queen is not a specimen. She is a peer. She watches us watching her. The C-47 enhancement created something unprecedented—a predator that thinks like us. The question is not whether she is dangerous. The question is whether she has decided we are worth keeping alive."

### Frugowski's Protocol
- Do not approach within 40 feet
- Do not attempt to trap or tranquilize
- Acknowledge her presence (she responds to recognition)
- Leave offerings at the boundary (accepted but never acknowledged)

---

## UTILIZATION NOTES

### Research Value: INCALCULABLE
The Queen represents the upper boundary of pharmaceutical enhancement:
- **Cognitive Studies:** Brain scans attempted (she avoids capture equipment)
- **Behavioral Research:** Long-term observation only
- **Genetic Sampling:** Impossible (no contact protocols)

### PILLS Yield: N/A
The Queen cannot be harvested. Attempts would likely result in researcher fatalities.

### Taming Status: IMPOSSIBLE
The Queen chooses her associations. She has elected to maintain proximity to Frugowski. This is not domestication—it is mutual tolerance, perhaps curiosity.

---

## SIGNAL RELATIONSHIP

Unlike Signal-sensitive specimens, the Queen demonstrates **Signal comprehension**:
- Alters behavior before Signal storms (predictive)
- Uses Signal interference to mask her movements
- Has been observed watching Signal-emitting ruins for hours

KERMIT Hypothesis: "She may perceive the Signal as we perceive weather—a force to be understood and utilized. If correct, she is the only non-human on Degenora with this level of Signal awareness."

## TERMINAL 7-B ARCHIVE NOTES

**First Recorded Sighting:** Year 1, Day 187  
**Documented By:** Big Frugowski (FR-003)  
**Current Distribution:** Forest Sector, Zone C2 (Observation House 04 vicinity)  
**Population Trend:** UNIQUE (n=1)

> "Year 15. She still comes. Every New Year's at midnight. Sits at exactly 40 feet. Waits exactly 12 minutes. Then leaves. I don't know what it means. I don't know if it's a ritual, a reminder, or just her way of saying she remembers. But I wait for her too now. We're trapped in this together, her and me. The only two thinking creatures on this island who understand what it means to be alone."
