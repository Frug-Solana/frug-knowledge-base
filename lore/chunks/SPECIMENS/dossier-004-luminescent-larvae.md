# SPECIMEN DOSSIER #004
## Larva Bioluminis
**Common Designation:** Luminescent Larvae / Glow Grubs  
**Threat Level:** Negligible (1/10)  
**Classification:** Aquatic Insect Larvae / Pharmaceutical Concentrator  
**Discovery:** Year 1, concurrent with Bog Hopper documentation

---

## VISUAL IDENTIFICATION

Luminescent Larvae are the foundational organism of the wetland pharmaceutical ecosystem:

- **Size:** 3-8cm length, 0.5-1cm diameter
- **Body Structure:** Segmented, soft-bodied, no defensive structures
- **Bioluminescence:** Pale blue-green glow (wavelength ~480nm)
- **Cluster Behavior:** Forms dense aggregations ("glow clusters") on submerged surfaces
- **Movement:** Undulating swimming, slow crawling on substrate

> **Field Note:** "They look like someone dropped stars in the pond. Thousands of them, pulsing in unison. Beautiful. And absolutely essential—without these larvae, the entire wetland food chain collapses."
> — Field Researcher Chen, Wetlands Survey

## BEHAVIORAL ANALYSIS

### Pharmaceutical Concentration
Luminescent Larvae are the **primary concentrators** of waterborne pharmaceutical compounds:

- **Filtration Rate:** Individual larva processes 2L water/day
- **Compound Accumulation:** Stores B-12X, L-19, and trace C-47 in body tissues
- **Bioluminescence Correlation:** Glow intensity directly proportional to compound concentration
- **Maturation:** Pupate after 60-90 days (adult form unknown/unobserved)

### Environmental Indicators
The larvae serve as real-time water quality monitors:
- **Bright, steady glow:** High pharmaceutical concentration, stable conditions
- **Flickering/dim:** Contamination or environmental stress
- **Color shift (blue→yellow):** C-47 variant presence (rare, concerning)

### Defense Mechanisms
- **None:** Soft-bodied, slow-moving, no toxins
- **Survival Strategy:** Sheer population numbers (millions per hectare)
- **Predator Satiation:** So abundant that predation cannot eliminate population

## HAZARD ASSESSMENT

### Direct Threat: NEGLIGIBLE
Luminescent Larvae pose no physical danger to humans or specimens.

### Indirect Considerations
| Factor | Assessment |
|--------|------------|
| Consumption | Safe (cooked), raw may cause mild nausea |
| Pharmaceutical Load | High—may trigger sensitivity in some individuals |
| Ecological | CRITICAL—wetland ecosystem foundation species |

### KERMIT Assessment
> "The larvae are not remarkable for what they are, but for what they enable. Every Bog Hopper, every Deep Dweller, every predator in the wetlands feeds on these glowing worms. They concentrate the island's essence. Without them, Degenora would be just another contaminated rock. With them, it is a pharmacy with a heartbeat."

## UTILIZATION NOTES

### Harvest Protocol
| Method | PILLS Yield | Ecological Impact |
|--------|-------------|-------------------|
| Sustainable (50% cluster) | 3-5 | Minimal |
| Aggressive (full cluster) | 8-12 | Moderate (recovery: 7 days) |
| First Discovery | 25 (one-time) | N/A |

### Crafting Applications
- **Signal Attunement Bait:** 5x larvae → attracts Signal-sensitive specimens
- **Pharmaceutical Extract:** 10x larvae → base for potion crafting
- **Bioluminescent Dye:** 3x larvae → glow-in-the-dark marking compound

### Nutritional Value
- **Protein Content:** 45% dry weight
- **Pharmaceutical Load:** Moderate (cooking reduces by 60%)
- **Taste:** Mild, slightly sweet (described as "shrimp-like")
- **Colony Usage:** Dried larvae standard ration component

## ECOLOGICAL ROLE

### Foundation Species
Luminescent Larvae occupy the critical base of the wetland food web:

```
PHARMACEUTICAL COMPOUNDS (waterborne)
    ↓ absorbed by
LUMINESCENT LARVAE (concentration)
    ↓ consumed by
BOG HOPPERS → DEEP DIVERS → APEX PREDATORS
    ↓ scavenged by
DETRITIVORES (nutrient recycling)
```

### Population Dynamics
- **Density:** 10,000-50,000 individuals per square meter (optimal habitat)
- **Reproduction:** Continuous (no seasonal cycle detected)
- **Lifespan:** 60-90 days (larval stage)
- **Mortality:** 95% consumed by predators (sustainable due to reproduction rate)

## TERMINAL 7-B ARCHIVE NOTES

**First Recorded Sighting:** Year 1, Day 30  
**Documented By:** Field Researcher Chen (implied from Bog Hopper diet study)  
**Current Distribution:** All standing water in Zones A2-A4, B1-B3  
**Population Trend:** STABLE (expanding with wetland boundaries)

> "The larvae are the swamp's answer to plankton. In a normal ecosystem, algae would fill this role. Here, something more complex evolved—or was created. The pharmaceutical contamination didn't kill them. It became them. They are the first link in a chain that leads all the way to the Apex Glimmer. Understand the larvae, and you understand Degenora's secret: poison became food, and food became power."
