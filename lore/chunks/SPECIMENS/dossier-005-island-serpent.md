# SPECIMEN DOSSIER #005
## Vipera Insulae
**Common Designation:** Island Serpent  
**Threat Level:** Moderate (5/10)  
**Classification:** Venomous Reptile / Pharmaceutical Contamination  
**Discovery:** Year 4, Medical Officer Reyes (toxicity study)

---

## VISUAL IDENTIFICATION

Island Serpents represent baseline viper morphology enhanced by island contamination:

- **Size:** 1.5-2.5m length, 3-6kg mass (significantly larger than mainland vipers)
- **Coloration:** Mottled green dominant with brown patterning (camouflage-adapted)
- **Head Structure:** Triangular, with heat-sensing pits (enhanced sensitivity)
- **Venom Delivery:** Hypodermic fangs, 8-12mm length
- **Scales:** Keeled (ridged), providing grip in wet environments

> **Medical Log:** "Year 4, Case 47. Farmer bitten while harvesting tall grass. Standard antivenin administered—no effect. Patient deteriorated rapidly. Required 3x dosage plus experimental serum. Survived, but with permanent neurological damage. Venom is... evolving."
> — Medical Officer Reyes, Emergency Report

---

## BEHAVIORAL ANALYSIS

### Venom Evolution
The Island Serpent's venom demonstrates alarming enhancement:
- **Toxicity Increase:** 300% more potent than Year 0 baseline
- **Compound Profile:** Contains pharmaceutical contamination signatures
- **Neurological Component:** Newly evolved neurotoxin (not present in original species)
- **Antivenin Resistance:** Standard treatments require 2-4x dosage

### Hunting Behavior
- **Ambush Predator:** Remains motionless for 6-48 hours
- **Strike Range:** 1.5x body length (exceptional for viperidae)
- **Prey Spectrum:** Rodents, small specimens, juvenile Bog Hoppers, unlucky colonists
- **Feeding Frequency:** Every 10-14 days (metabolism slowed by island conditions)

### Defensive Behavior
- **Warning Signs:** Hissing, coiled S-posture, tail vibration (mimics rattlesnake)
- **Strike Probability:** 70% if approached within 2m
- **Flight Response:** Will retreat if given escape route
- **Pursuit:** Rare—typically hold ground rather than chase

## HAZARD ASSESSMENT

### Direct Threat: MODERATE
| Envenomation Grade | Symptoms | Treatment Required |
|-------------------|----------|-------------------|
| Mild (20% of bites) | Local pain, swelling | Standard antivenin |
| Moderate (50%) | Systemic effects, nausea | 2x antivenin dose |
| Severe (25%) | Paralysis, respiratory distress | 4x dose + life support |
| Lethal (5%) | Cardiac arrest, brain hemorrhage | Experimental protocols |

### Environmental Risk
- **Habitat:** Tall grass, agricultural sector, ruins
- **Camouflage:** Nearly invisible in vegetation
- **Seasonal Activity:** Year-round (no brumation observed)
- **Population Density:** 2-5 per hectare (highest in Zone C1)

### KERMIT Warning
> "The serpents are not evil. They are efficient. The pharmaceutical contamination made them better at what they were already doing—killing. Every year, the venom grows stronger. Every year, more colonists learn to fear the tall grass. Walk with a stick. Strike the ground ahead of you. Let them know you're coming. It's only polite."

## UTILIZATION NOTES

### Venom Harvesting (High Risk)
| Method | PILLS Yield | Risk Level |
|--------|-------------|------------|
| Milking (restrained) | 15-25 | High (professional only) |
| Post-combat extraction | 10-20 | Moderate (from carcass) |
| Discovery bonus | 75 (one-time) | N/A |

### Crafting Applications
- **Neurotoxin Extract:** 3x venom sacs → weapon coating (+poison damage)
- **Antivenin Precursor:** 5x venom samples → antidote crafting
- **Research Sample:** 1x venom → laboratory studies (high PILLS payout)

### Combat Statistics
| Attribute | Value |
|-----------|-------|
| HP | 40 |
| Speed | 8 (strike) / 4 (movement) |
| Attack | 14 (venom bite) / 6 (constrict) |
| Defense | 4 |
| Special | Venom (damage over time, 3 turns) |

## ECOLOGICAL ROLE

### Population Control
Island Serpents regulate small mammal and juvenile specimen populations:
- **Rodent Predation:** Primary food source (60% of diet)
- **Specimen Control:** Consumes weakened or young specimens
- **Competition:** Outcompetes non-venomous snakes (3 native species eliminated)

### Pharmaceutical Vector
Serpents may serve as mobile contamination distributors:
- Venom contains active pharmaceutical compounds
- Bites may introduce island-specific pathogens
- Some researchers theorize serpents concentrate compounds like larvae

## TERMINAL 7-B ARCHIVE NOTES

**First Recorded Sighting:** Year 4, Day 89  
**Documented By:** Medical Officer Reyes (toxicity documentation)  
**Current Distribution:** All grassland zones, Agricultural Sector, Zone C1-C3  
**Population Trend:** INCREASING (+15% annually, concerning)

> "Year 15 update: We've stopped counting bites. There are too many. The agricultural sector now requires serpent-proof boots as standard equipment—mandatory, not recommended. I've proposed a controlled cull program three times. Denied each time. 'Let the ecosystem balance itself,' they say. Meanwhile, my infirmary fills with farmers who trusted the tall grass."
> — Medical Officer Reyes, Terminal 7-B
