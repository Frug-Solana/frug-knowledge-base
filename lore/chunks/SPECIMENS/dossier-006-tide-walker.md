# SPECIMEN DOSSIER #006
## Ambulatores Aestus
**Common Designation:** Tide Walker  
**Threat Level:** High (7/10)  
**Classification:** Amphibious Crustacean / Nocturnal Predator  
**Discovery:** Year 2, recovered from coastal survivor logs

---

## VISUAL IDENTIFICATION

Tide Walkers are among the most alien specimens documented on Degenora—a fusion of crustacean and unknown biology:

- **Size:** 2-3m height when upright, 150-250kg mass
- **Body Structure:** Bipedal stance, chitinous exoskeleton, six appendages total
- **Carapace:** Iridescent blue-green, changes hue with tidal phases
- **Limbs:** Two primary walking legs (powerful, jointed backward), four manipulator arms
- **Sensory Organs:** No visible eyes—navigates via vibration and electromagnetic sense
- **Respiration:** Dual system (gills and lung-like structures)

> **Recovered Log Entry:** "They come when the tide goes out. Not from the water—from the wet sand itself. Like something squeezed up from beneath. Tall as a man, but wrong. Arms too many. No face I could see. Just that clicking sound. Click-click-click. Then screaming."
> — Unidentified coastal survivor, Year 2 (log recovered from abandoned shelter)

## BEHAVIORAL ANALYSIS

### Tidal Synchronization
Tide Walkers exhibit behavior perfectly attuned to lunar cycles:
- **Activity Window:** 2 hours before to 2 hours after low tide
- **Emergence:** Burrow upward from saturated sand as tide recedes
- **Retreat:** Return to subterranean chambers as water returns
- **Lunar Peak:** Maximum activity during new and full moons

### Hunting Methodology
- **Vibration Detection:** Senses footsteps through sand up to 100m
- **Ambush Strategy:** Buries itself in wet sand, waits for prey overhead
- **Capture Technique:** Erupts upward, seizing victims with manipulator arms
- **Feeding:** Drags prey underground—consumption never directly observed

### Social Structure
- **Solitary Hunters:** Never observed in groups
- **Territorial:** Males clash violently during breeding season (audible underwater)
- **Communication:** Clicking vocalizations (purpose unknown—may be echolocation)

## HAZARD ASSESSMENT

### Direct Threat: HIGH
| Behavior | Effect |
|----------|--------|
| Subterranean Ambush | +75% damage if undetected (victim surprised) |
| Buried Strike | Ignores standard defensive positioning |
| Drag Under | Automatic critical if capture successful |
| Exoskeleton Armor | 50% damage reduction from standard weapons |

### Statistical Profile
| Attribute | Value |
|-----------|-------|
| HP | 120 |
| Attack | 18 (claw) / 14 (crush) |
| Defense | 14 |
| Speed | 6 (land) / 12 (burrow) |
| Danger Level | 7/10 |
| Tame Difficulty | 10/10 (believed impossible) |

### Environmental Hazard
- **Habitat:** Beaches, tidal flats, saturated sand zones
- **Invisibility:** Undetectable when buried (no thermal signature)
- **Nocturnal:** Night activity increases threat level significantly
- **Escape Difficulty:** Pursues onto dry land for short distances (50-100m)

### KERMIT Warning
> "The Tide Walkers are old. Older than the colony. Older than Frugowski's arrival. Perhaps older than the Signal itself. They were here when this was just an island. The pills didn't create them—they merely woke something that was sleeping in the deep sand. Do not walk the beaches at night. Do not trust the wet sand. The Tide Walkers remember when the island was theirs alone."

## UTILIZATION NOTES

### Combat Rewards
| Source | PILLS Yield | Probability |
|--------|-------------|-------------|
| Defeat (Standard) | 150-200 | 50% |
| Defeat (Rare Drop) | 400-600 | 10% |
| Carapace Harvest | 50-75 | 100% |
| Discovery Bonus | 300 (one-time) | N/A |

### Harvestable Materials
| Material | Rarity | Application |
|----------|--------|-------------|
| Tide Carapace | Uncommon | Water-resistant armor crafting |
| Echo Chamber | Rare | Sonic device components |
| Tide Gland | Very Rare | Breathing apparatus (water adaptation) |

### WARNING
Tide Walker materials degrade rapidly if not processed within 6 hours of harvest. Coastal processing stations required for maximum yield.

## ECOLOGICAL ROLE

### Apex Coastal Predator
Tide Walkers dominate the shoreline ecosystem:
- **Prey Spectrum:** Beach fauna, washed-up specimens, unlucky colonists
- **Population Control:** Regulates shore-scavenging species
- **Burrow Ecosystem:** Abandoned tunnels used by smaller specimens

### Pharmaceutical Connection
Unknown—specimens cannot be studied in laboratory conditions:
- May concentrate compounds from filtered sand
- Carapace shows pharmaceutical residue traces
- Hypothesis: Subterranean filtration system similar to larvae

## TERMINAL 7-B ARCHIVE NOTES

**First Recorded Sighting:** Year 2, Day 203  
**Documentation Source:** Recovered survivor logs, beach remains analysis  
**Current Distribution:** Coastal Sector, Zones D1-D2, all tidal beaches  
**Population Trend:** UNKNOWN (subterranean, impossible to census)

> "We don't know how many there are. We don't know how deep they burrow. We don't know if they're intelligent or just perfectly adapted. What we know: 23 colonists have disappeared from beaches. Only 4 bodies recovered. The rest... taken under. I've marked the safe zones on the coastal maps. Stay within them. The Tide Walkers own the shore. We merely visit."
