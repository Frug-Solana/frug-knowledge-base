# SPECIMEN DOSSIER #007
## Umbrascens Reptilia
**Common Designation:** Void Crawler  
**Threat Level:** High (6/10)  
**Classification:** Chitinous Predator / Signal-Edge Hunter  
**Discovery:** Year 3, recovered from survivor's journal, Zone C4

---

## VISUAL IDENTIFICATION

Void Crawlers are chitinous, quadrupedal predators roughly the size of large terrestrial canids (40-60kg, 1.2-1.5m length). Distinguishing characteristics:

- **Exoskeleton:** Absorbs visible light, creating "shadowy" two-dimensional appearance
- **Eyes:** NONE — navigates via alternative sensory methods
- **Limbs:** Six jointed legs ending in hooked talons (climbing-adapted)
- **Mouthparts:** Triple mandible arrangement, capable of crushing bone
- **Carapace Markings:** Subtle geometric patterns visible only under UV light

> **Recovery Journal Entry:** "They don't look real. Like something cut a shadow out of the world and taught it to walk. You see the teeth first—yellow-white against all that dark. Then you hear the skittering. If you're still standing when you hear the skittering, you're already dead."

## BEHAVIORAL ANALYSIS

### Hunting Methodology
Void Crawlers exhibit advanced predatory behavior:

1. **Ambush Phase:** Remains motionless for 12-72 hours
2. **Thermal Mimicry:** Body temperature matches ambient ruins
3. **Detection Range:** Electromagnetic field sensitivity to 50m
4. **Strike Speed:** 0.4 seconds from detection to contact

### Sensory Adaptation
- **Echolocation:** Subsonic pulse emission (below human hearing threshold)
- **Electroreception:** Detects bioelectric signatures of living creatures
- **Signal Sensitivity:** Drawn to Signal but cannot survive prolonged exposure

### Migration Patterns
Void Crawlers patrol the **Signal borderlands**—the zones where Signal saturation drops from lethal to survivable. This creates a constant threat perimeter around high-Signal zones.

## HAZARD ASSESSMENT

### Direct Threat: HIGH
| Combat Behavior | Effect |
|-----------------|--------|
| Ambush Strike | +50% damage if undetected |
| Pack Coordination | +2 Attack per ally within 20m (max +6) |
| Shadow Blend | +50% evasion in low-light conditions |
| Weakness | Bright light stuns for 1 turn |

### Statistical Profile
| Attribute | Value |
|-----------|-------|
| HP | 65 |
| Attack | 12 |
| Defense | 8 |
| Danger Level | 6/10 |
| Tame Difficulty | 8/10 (not recommended) |

### KERMIT Risk Assessment
> "Void Crawlers are the leading cause of explorer fatalities in Zones B3-C4. They are intelligent, patient, and inexplicably hostile. Recommendation: Avoid territory, travel in daylight, carry high-lumen light sources. Attempting to 'tame' a Void Crawler has a 94% fatality rate. The remaining 6% lost limbs."

---

## SIGNAL RELATIONSHIP

Void Crawlers present a biological paradox:

- **Attraction:** Drawn to Signal emitters
- **Intolerance:** Prolonged Signal exposure (>30 minutes) causes cellular breakdown
- **Behavioral Result:** Perpetual migration around Signal edges

KERMIT Hypothesis: "The creatures may be adapted to pre-Signal Degenora fauna, now trapped in behavioral loops by the Signal's presence. They hunt the edges because they cannot enter the center."

## UTILIZATION NOTES

### Combat Rewards
| Source | PILLS Yield | Probability |
|--------|-------------|-------------|
| Defeat (Standard) | 80-120 | 60% |
| Defeat (Rare Drop) | 200-300 | 15% |
| Chitin Harvest | 25-40 | 100% |
| Tame Completion | 500 (one-time) | N/A |
| Discovery Bonus | 150 (one-time) | N/A |

### Harvestable Materials
| Material | Rarity | Application |
|----------|--------|-------------|
| Void Chitin | Common | Stealth armor crafting |
| Echo Gland | Uncommon | Perception-enhancing consumables |
| Shadow Membrane | Rare | Advanced camouflage technology |

### WARNING
Void Crawler chitin degrades rapidly outside Degenora's atmosphere. Process on-island only.

## ENCOUNTERS BY ZONE

| Zone | Spawn Rate | Notes |
|------|------------|-------|
| B3, B4 | 18% base | Medium-risk border zones |
| C3, C4 | 24% base | Higher density near ruins |
| Night Cycle | 3x multiplier | Nocturnal hunting behavior |
| Signal Storms | 0.5x multiplier | Seek shelter during events |

## TERMINAL 7-B ARCHIVE NOTES

**First Recorded Encounter:** Year 3, Day 287  
**Documentation Source:** Recovered journal (partial), Zone C4 ruins  
**Current Distribution:** Signal borderlands, all medium-risk zones  
**Population Trend:** STABLE (controlled by Signal intolerance)

> "I've mapped seventeen Void Crawler territories. They don't overlap. They don't share. Each Crawler claims a section of borderland and defends it against everything—including other Crawlers. The maps are in the secure files. Don't go to those coordinates without heavy weapons and a faster runner than you."
