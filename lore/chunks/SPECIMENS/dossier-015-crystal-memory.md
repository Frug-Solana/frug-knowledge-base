## THREAT ASSESSMENT

| Parameter | Rating |
|-----------|--------|
| **Danger Level** | 4/10 |
| **Hostility** | Non-hostile (Indirect hazard) |
| **Tame Difficulty** | N/A (Non-organic) |
| **Recommended Approach** | Caution — maintain 5m minimum distance |

**HAZARD WARNINGS:**
- Static field interference with absentee systems
- Memory shock potential on physical contact
- Psychologically destabilizing content in recovered memories
- Resonance amplification in cluster formations

## PHYSICAL DESCRIPTION

Crystal Memory Formations are silicon-based structures exhibiting impossible geometric precision. They range from fist-sized clusters to cathedral-scale formations, all growing in mathematically perfect patterns around the oldest ruins of Degenora.

**Key Characteristics:**
- Hexagonal crystalline lattice structure
- Translucent to opaque depending on memory density
- Bioluminescent glow in Signal-frequency spectrum
- Growth rate: approximately 2cm per year under optimal conditions
- Density: 2.65 g/cm³ (similar to quartz, anomalous given structure)

The formations show no signs of tool marks or extraction points, suggesting either natural (though impossible) growth or manufacturing techniques beyond current understanding.

## BEHAVIORAL ANALYSIS

### Memory Recording Phenomenon

When touched by living creatures, Crystal Memory Formations demonstrate the ability to "record" neural patterns. These recordings persist indefinitely and can be "played back" to subsequent touchers. The mechanism remains unknown—no biological components have been identified within the crystal structure.

**Recording Characteristics:**
- Trigger: Direct skin contact (synthetic barriers partially effective)
- Duration: 0.3-2.7 seconds of contact required for full recording
- Persistence: Appears permanent (oldest readable memory: 47 years)
- Fidelity: Highly variable—some memories crisp as direct experience, others fragmented

### Static Field Generation

Active formations generate an electromagnetic field that interferes with absentee operation:

| Distance | Effect |
|----------|--------|
| 0-2m | Severe interference (-15% action efficiency) |
| 2-5m | Moderate interference (-5% action efficiency) |
| 5-10m | Mild interference (-2% action efficiency) |
| 10m+ | No measurable effect |

### Resonance Effect

Multiple formations within 10 meters of each other demonstrate field amplification:
- 2 formations: 1.5x field strength
- 3-5 formations: 2x field strength
- 6+ formations: Non-linear amplification (unpredictable effects)

**Terminal 7-B Note:** *"The resonance data doesn't make sense. It's like they're talking to each other. — Archivist Kael"*

## FIELD NOTES & ENCOUNTERS

### Expedition Log 734 — Zone C2

> *"The crystal showed me things. Not hallucinations—memories. Someone else's memories. I saw the world before, the green world. I don't think I was supposed to see that. I don't think the crystal wanted me to leave."*
> — Anonymous, recovered expedition log, author deceased

**Context:** This log represents the first confirmed case of pre-Signal memory recovery. The "green world" description matches no known Degenora topography, suggesting the memory predates the Event by significant margin.

### Researcher Vex — Controlled Contact Study

> *"Subject touched formation for 1.2 seconds. Reported experiencing approximately three hours of another person's life—farming activities in a location with blue vegetation. Subject required 48 hours psychological monitoring. Memory content classified pending verification."*

**Terminal 7-B Note:** *"Blue vegetation. Pre-Event Earth flora records mention nothing of the kind. Either the memories are fabricated, or we're looking at something from much further back than we thought. — Archivist Kael"*

### Formation Growth Survey — Zone D1

Multiple large-scale formations measured and catalogued. Growth patterns suggest accelerated development correlating with Signal intensity increases. Formations near active emitters show 340% faster growth rate than baseline.

**Hypothesis:** The crystals may be a storage medium for consciousness or data left by the ruin builders. Signal intensification may be "awakening" dormant formations.

## UTILIZATION NOTES

### Harvesting Protocol

| Formation Size | PILLS Yield | Risk Level |
|----------------|-------------|------------|
| Small cluster (fist-sized) | 100-150 | Low |
| Medium formation (body-sized) | 200-300 | Moderate |
| Large formation (room-sized) | 400-600 | High |
| Cathedral-scale | Unknown | Extreme — not recommended |

**Warning:** Harvesting destroys memory storage capacity. Terminal 7-B recommends documenting all recoverable memories before harvest.

### Applications

**Crafting:**
- Required component for Memory Banks (absentee inventory expansion)
- Signal attenuation equipment
- Neural interface prototypes

**Research:**
- Lore unlocks (50 PILLS per unique memory)
- Zone map data recovery
- Hidden entrance revelation (rare)

**Trade:**
- Base value: 200 PILLS to Archive faction
- Premium pricing for formations with confirmed pre-Event memories

## ZONE DISTRIBUTION

| Zone | Encounter Rate | Typical Formation Size |
|------|----------------|------------------------|
| C2 | 12% | Small to medium |
| C3 | 15% | Medium |
| D1 | 8% | Medium to large |
| D2 | 10% | Large |

**Preferred Environment:** Ancient ruins, particularly structures showing advanced pre-Event construction techniques. Never found in natural cave systems or surface exposures.

## TERMINAL 7-B ARCHIVE ADDENDUM

> *"The Crystal Memory Formations worry me more than the Crawlers. At least Crawlers just want to eat you. These things... they're storing something. Waiting for something. Every time the Signal spikes, we get reports of new formations 'blooming'— Emitting light patterns, audio frequencies, sometimes even text in languages nobody recognizes."*
> 
> *"I've catalogued 127 unique memories so far. Farming memories. War memories. Memories of stars that don't match our sky. One researcher swore she experienced a memory of being inside the Signal itself, looking out at us."*
> 
> *"We don't know what they are. We don't know who made them. But they're getting more active, and I don't think that's good news."*
>
