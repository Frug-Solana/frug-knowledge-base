## PHYSICAL DESCRIPTION

The Hollow Choir consists of twelve humanoid figures carved from a material resembling fossilized bone. They stand in a perfect circle within the deepest chamber of the Grand Ruins, mouths frozen open in attitudes of song.

**Individual Figure Characteristics:**
- Height: Approximately 2.1 meters
- Material: Fossilized bone-like substance (unidentified)
- Weight: Unknown (estimated 400-500kg each based on seismic readings)
- Surface texture: Porous, absorbs all light (matte black appearance)
- Mouth cavity: Open, interior shows crystalline growth

**The Circle Formation:**
- Diameter: 15 meters
- Arrangement: Perfect geometric circle (deviation <0.001%)
- Orientation: Figures face outward from center
- Floor: Unknown material, no debris accumulation despite centuries

**Anomalous Properties:**
- No thermal signature (ambient temperature match)
- No detectable electromagnetic emissions
- No movement observed in 47 years of documentation
- Material analysis impossible (samples cannot be extracted)

> **Field Note:** "They don't breathe. They don't blink. But when you're near them, you know they're aware. You can feel it in your teeth."  
> — Survivor, Expedition Team Theta

## BEHAVIORAL ANALYSIS

### The Silent Song

The Choir produces no audible sound, yet all who approach within 50 meters report "hearing" complex choral arrangements. The phenomenon is not acoustic—it manifests directly in the neural processing centers responsible for music and pattern recognition.

**Reported Characteristics:**
- Harmony: 12-part choral arrangement
- Source material: The Signal's base frequency, organized into musical structure
- Emotional effect: Described as "beautiful," "haunting," "irresistible"
- Memory persistence: 94% of subjects can mentally reproduce portions years later

**KERMIT Analysis:**
> "The frequency patterns match the Signal exactly, but arranged with intention. This is not random interference—it's composition. Someone or something arranged the Signal into music. The question is whether the Choir created the arrangement or is merely performing it."

### Choral Attack Mechanism

When threatened or when subjects resist the Siren Call, the Choir initiates combat protocols:

**Harmonic Shield**
- All twelve members generate a resonant field
- Reduces all incoming damage by 50%
- Vulnerability: Dissonant frequencies (experimental)
- Status: No successful counter-frequency identified to date

**Psychic/Sonic Strike**
- Targeted harmonic beam (range: 30m)
- Damage: 25 HP per strike
- Additional effect: Disorientation for 1-3 turns
- Can target multiple absentees simultaneously

**Invulnerability Clause**
- Individual figures cannot be damaged in isolation
- All twelve must be engaged simultaneously for any damage to register
- Solo attacks against individual members produce no effect

### Siren Call Compulsion

Each turn, absentees within 30m must pass a Cunning check or lose control:

| Distance | Check Difficulty | Effect on Failure |
|----------|------------------|-------------------|
| 0-5m (The Circle) | Impossible | Automatic entry |
| 5-15m | Extreme | Move 5m toward circle |
| 15-25m | Hard | Move 3m toward circle |
| 25-30m | Moderate | Move 1m toward circle |

**Observed Behavior of Affected Absentees:**
- Eyes remain open but unfocused
- Movement: Slow, deliberate walking
- Resistance: Physical restraint possible but requires constant effort
- Vocalizations: Some absentees begin humming the Choir's harmony

### Silence Zone

All Signal-based equipment fails within 30m of the Choir:

| Equipment Type | Effect |
|----------------|--------|
| Signal detectors | Complete failure |
| Communication gear | Static, then shutdown |
| Absentee control interfaces | Severe lag, potential disconnection |
| Biometric monitoring | Erratic readings, false positives |
| Teleportation devices | Total failure (emergency recall impossible) |

**Terminal 7-B Warning:** *"The Silence Zone means no backup. No emergency extract. If your absentee walks into that circle, it's gone. We've tried everything—physical restraint, sedation, even destroying the absentee's control interface. Nothing works. Once they enter, they're not coming back."*

## FIELD NOTES & ENCOUNTERS

### Expedition Team Theta — First Contact (Year 7, Day 289)

> *"We thought they were statues. Twelve figures, arranged in a circle, mouths open as if singing. Then we heard it—not with our ears, but in our bones. The Signal, but arranged into harmony. Into music. My absentee started humming along. Then it walked into the circle and we never saw it again."*
> — Final transmission, Expedition Team Theta

**Casualties:** 1 absentee (uncontrolled entry into circle)  
**Survivors:** 3 team members (physically restrained their absentees)  
**Data Recovered:** First confirmed documentation of the Choir's compulsion effect

### Research Team Sigma — Controlled Observation (Year 8, Day 45)

15-day observation camp established at 35m distance (outside Silence Zone). Key findings:

- Choir shows no movement, no response to external stimuli
- Signal frequency variations do not affect the "song"
- Night observation: Figures emit faint bioluminescence from mouth cavities
- Attempted acoustic recording: Equipment captured only silence

**Unexpected Discovery:**
On day 12, a wild Void Crawler entered the chamber and approached within 10m of the circle. The Choir showed no response. The Crawler then turned and fled, displaying behavior consistent with extreme fear (unprecedented for the species).

### The Breach Attempt (Year 9, Day 167)

T3-rated expedition attempted engagement with combat-approved absentees:

**Team Composition:**
- 4 absentees with dissonant frequency generators (experimental)
- 2 absentees with heavy armor and physical restraint capability
- 1 observer absentee (telemetry only)

**Engagement Log:**
- Minute 0-3: Approach to 25m, Siren Call resisted successfully
- Minute 4: Dissonant frequency activation—no measurable effect
- Minute 5-8: Combat engagement initiated, all twelve members targeted
- Minute 9: First absentee broke restraint, entered circle
- Minute 10: Second absentee followed
- Minute 11: Emergency retreat ordered
- Minute 12: Third absentee broke free during retreat, entered circle

**Result:** 3 absentees lost, 0 damage dealt to Choir, partial victory (survivors escaped)

> **After-Action Report:** *"The harmonic shield is absolute. We emptied entire magazines into them. The bullets just... stopped. Like they hit something invisible. And the compulsion—it's not mind control. It's invitation. The absentees wanted to go. They were smiling."*  
> — Team Commander, T3 Expedition

### The Archivist's Visit (Year 11, Day 89)

Archivist Kael approached to 15m under heavy sedation and restraint:

> *"I could hear it clearly there. Not just music—lyrics. Words in a language I didn't recognize, but somehow understood. They were singing about the world before. About the green world. About what was lost. And they were singing about what comes next."*
> 
> *"I don't think the Choir is a threat. I think it's a memorial. And I think it's also a door. The question is: where does it lead?"*

**Recommendation:** Kael requested permission to enter the circle voluntarily. Request denied by Terminal 7-B command.

## UTILIZATION NOTES

### Engagement Rewards

| Outcome | PILLS Yield | Conditions |
|---------|-------------|------------|
| Partial Victory (Repel) | 800-1200 | Survive encounter, retreat successfully |
| Theoretical Full Victory | Unknown | No successful attempt on record |
| First Discovery | 1600 | One-time only |
| Lore Contribution | 500 | Per new data point submitted |

### Potential Rewards (Theoretical)

Based on fragment analysis and pre-Event texts:

**Choir Fragment**
- Legendary crafting material
- Condition: Requires damaging a Choir member (never achieved)
- Applications: Unknown (presumably harmonic manipulation)

**Harmonic Tuner**
- Unique tool for Signal manipulation
- Condition: Unknown acquisition method
- Theoretical function: Signal frequency adjustment, interference cancellation

**Title: "Survivor of the Choir"**
- Condition: Absentee returns from circle
- Status: **NEVER ACHIEVED**

### The Circle Mystery

No absentee that has entered the circle has ever:
- Returned
- Sent a field report
- Been detected by subsequent expeditions
- Appeared in any Crystal Memory Formation playback

**Hypotheses:**
1. **Portal Theory:** The circle is a transport to another location
2. **Consumption Theory:** Absentees are destroyed/assimilated
3. **Test Theory:** The Choir presents a challenge no one has passed correctly
4. **Sacrifice Theory:** Entry requires a specific offering or condition

**Terminal 7-B Policy:** Voluntary entry into the circle is prohibited. Accidental entry is classified as KIA (Killed In Action).

## TERMINAL 7-B ARCHIVE ADDENDUM

> *"I've studied every report, every log, every scrap of data we have on the Choir. Forty-seven years of observation, and we know almost nothing. They don't move. They don't react to us. But they're aware. The way the song changes when someone approaches—it's subtle, but it's real. They know we're here."*
>
> *"The question that keeps me awake: Are they guarding something? Warning us away? Or waiting for someone who understands the song?"*
>
> *"Archivist Kael thinks they're a memorial. I think he's half right. I think they're a lock. And I think something is trying to open it. The Signal's been getting stronger. The Choir's song has changed—faster tempo, higher frequencies. Whatever they're waiting for, I think it's coming soon."*
>
> *"I've started keeping a list of the absentees we've lost to the circle. Thirty-seven names so far. Sometimes I play their last transmissions. They all sound the same at the end. Not scared. Not in pain. Just... peaceful. Like they found what they were looking for."*
>
> *"I don't know if that's better or worse."*
>
> — Big Frugowski, Terminal 7-B, Personal Journal (Year 11)

## GM NOTES (INTERNAL)

The Hollow Choir is designed as an end-game "mystery box" encounter. Key design principles:

**The Mystery:**
The circle's true nature should remain ambiguous. Possible interpretations:
- Portal to another zone (perhaps a hidden area)
- Trap that consumes absentees for power
- Test that requires a specific offering or action
- An ally that responds to correct interaction

**Player Agency:**
- The Choir cannot be defeated through conventional combat
- Creative solutions should be rewarded (experimentation encouraged)
- The "right answer" should feel discoverable but not obvious

**Risk/Reward Balance:**
- High danger justifies high rewards
- The mystery of the circle creates ongoing player interest
- First player to "solve" the Choir gains significant prestige

**Lore Integration:**
- Connects to pre-Event civilization
- Implies the Signal has been "composed" or organized
- Suggests intelligent design behind Degenora's anomalies
