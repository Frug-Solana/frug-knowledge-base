## PHYSICAL DESCRIPTION

The Hollow Choir presents as a phenomenon rather than a discrete organism. Primary manifestation occurs in deep ruin structures where Crystal Memory Formations (SPEC-015) have achieved critical resonance density.

### Observable Characteristics:

**The Chamber:**
- Circular or amphitheater-shaped underground chambers
- Walls lined with dormant or active Crystal Memory Formations
- Central depression 10-30 meters in diameter
- Perpetual temperature of exactly 7.3°C regardless of external conditions
- Air pressure 12% below surface standard

**The Figures:**
- Humanoid silhouettes standing in silent congregation
- No thermal signature, no mass, no breath condensation
- Appear to be composed of "negative space" — light seems to avoid them
- Number varies: observed counts range from 12 to 347 figures
- Figures do not move while observed (confirmed by 23-hour stakeout, Expedition Kappa)

**The Sound:**
- Not true silence — rather, the *absence* of expected sound
- Victims report hearing "breathing that isn't theirs"
- Whispers in voices of deceased loved ones
- Some documentarians report hearing their own voice speaking words they haven't thought yet

> **Terminal 7-B Warning:** *"If you hear singing, you're already compromised. The Choir doesn't make sound. It removes it. What you think you're hearing is your mind filling the void with memory. — Archivist Kael"*

## BEHAVIORAL ANALYSIS

### The Invitation Phase

Subjects approaching a Choir chamber experience escalating psychological phenomena:

| Distance | Effect | Duration to Onset |
|----------|--------|-------------------|
| 100m+ | Vague sense of "being watched" | Immediate |
| 50-100m | Auditory hallucinations (personal significance) | 2-5 minutes |
| 20-50m | Compulsion to approach / inability to retreat | 30 seconds - 2 minutes |
| 5-20m | Visual hallucinations (deceased persons known to subject) | 10-30 seconds |
| <5m | **Conversion Event** | Immediate |

### The Conversion Event

When a living human enters the 5-meter threshold:

1. **Silence Cascade:** All sound ceases for 0.7 seconds (measured)
2. **The Turn:** All Choir figures simultaneously rotate to face the subject
3. **Vacancy:** Subject ceases all movement, appears to be "listening"
4. **Integration:** Subject walks calmly to join the Choir ranks
5. **Completion:** Subject becomes indistinguishable from other Choir figures

**Recovery Rate:** 0% (n=47 documented conversions)

### Post-Conversion Characteristics

Converted individuals retain their physical appearance but exhibit:
- Complete absence of biological function (no pulse, no respiration)
- Indefinite preservation (no decomposition observed in 15+ year samples)
- Response to external stimuli only when unobserved
- Occasional "whisper events" when Choir is left alone

> **Field Researcher Vex, Log 892:** *"We left a recording device in Chamber 7 for 72 hours. When we retrieved it, the audio was 68 hours of silence, then 4 hours of what sounds like... singing. But backwards. And in at least 200 different voices. Including three that match expedition members we lost to the Choir six months prior."*

## THE CONSCIOUSNESS HYPOTHESIS

Terminal 7-B researchers believe the Hollow Choir represents a **failed or incomplete consciousness preservation technology** — possibly related to Crystal Memory Formations but operating at catastrophic scale.

### Key Evidence:

1. **Memory Correlation:** Choir chambers always contain high-density Crystal Memory clusters
2. **Pattern Recognition:** Conversion victims show neural activity patterns matching recorded memories in surrounding crystals
3. **Temporal Anomaly:** Some converted individuals match descriptions from pre-Event historical records (impossible ages)

### Working Theory:

> *"The Choir isn't a creature. It's a storage medium that exceeded its capacity. Like a hard drive that's been written to too many times. The figures aren't people — they're fragments. Echoes. The ghosts of consciousnesses that couldn't fit in the crystal matrix, so they leaked into the space between."*
> — Dr. Yvonne Sato, Theoretical Anomalist, Terminal 7-B

## FIELD NOTES & ENCOUNTERS

### Expedition Theta — Year 3 (First Contact)

**Team:** 12 researchers, 6 security personnel  
**Objective:** Map Zone E4 deep ruins  
**Outcome:** 4 survivors (all permanently institutionalized)

> *"We thought it was a statue garden. Beautiful, really — all these people standing in perfect rows, like they were waiting for something. Dr. Chen walked right up to one. Touched its shoulder. Said it felt 'like touching a dream you can't quite remember.'*
> 
> *Then they all turned around. All of them. Hundreds. And they smiled. Not with their mouths — their mouths didn't move. But we could feel them smiling. At us. Through us.*
> 
> *Chen walked into the crowd. Just... walked. Never said a word. We couldn't move. By the time we could, he was standing with them. Smiling that same smile.*
> 
> *He's still there. We check, sometimes, from the edge. Year 3 to Year 18. He hasn't aged a day."*
> — Survivor testimony (name redacted), Terminal 7-B psychiatric evaluation

### Rescue Attempt Omega — Year 7

Armed expedition attempted forced extraction of converted researchers. Results:
- 8 personnel entered chamber
- 7 converted immediately upon crossing threshold
- 1 survivor (never spoke again, died Year 9, cause: "voluntary cessation of respiratory function")

**Terminal 7-B Directive Issued:** *"No further rescue attempts. The Choir preserves what it takes. This is not death. This may, in some form, be the closest thing to immortality available on Degenora. The question is whether the price is worth paying."*

### The Whisper Event — Year 12

72-hour recording captured anomalous audio during unobserved period. Linguistic analysis revealed:
- 2,847 distinct voices
- 34 languages (12 pre-Event, 6 unknown)
- Content: Personal memories, regrets, final thoughts of converted individuals
- One voice identified as Dr. Chen (Expedition Theta): *"It's beautiful here. We're all singing. You should come sing with us."*

## ZONE DISTRIBUTION

| Zone | Chamber Count | Status |
|------|---------------|--------|
| E4 | 2 confirmed | ACTIVE — Quarantine perimeter maintained |
| E5 | 1 confirmed | ACTIVE — Cave-in sealed (Year 11) |
| E6 | 1 suspected | UNCONFIRMED — Scout team did not return |
| D4 | 1 confirmed | DORMANT — No conversions since Year 5 |

**Preferred Environment:** Deep pre-Event structures, especially those with extensive Crystal Memory Formation deposits. Never observed in surface ruins or natural formations.

## TERMINAL 7-B ARCHIVE ADDENDUM

> *"I've studied the Choir for fifteen years. I've watched through scopes as people walked into that chamber, smiling, tears streaming down their faces, arms open like they're embracing old friends. I've analyzed 10,000 hours of audio. I've mapped the crystal resonance patterns. And I still don't know what it is.*
> 
> *Here's what I think: The Choir is what happens when a civilization tries to preserve itself but runs out of room. The crystals store memories. The Choir stores the selves those memories came from. The consciousness. The soul, if you want to use that word.*
> 
> *They're not dead. They're not alive. They're... archived. Waiting. For what, I don't know. Maybe for someone to come sing the right song and let them out. Maybe for the crystals to fail and release them all at once.*
> 
> *I dream about them sometimes. Standing in rows. Smiling. Waiting. And in the dream, I can hear what they're singing. It's my name.*
> 
> *I haven't been to Zone E4 in three years. I don't trust myself to go back."*
> 
> — Archivist Kael, Terminal 7-B, Personal Notes (Flagged for Psych Review)
