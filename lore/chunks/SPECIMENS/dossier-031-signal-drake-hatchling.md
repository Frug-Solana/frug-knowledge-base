## PHYSICAL DESCRIPTION

The Signal-Drake Hatchling represents the juvenile stage of *Draco Telemetrica*, a small draconic species uniquely adapted to the Signal-saturated environments of the Deep Ruins.

**General Characteristics:**
- Body Length: 45-60 cm (tail adds additional 30-40 cm)
- Wingspan: 1.2-1.5 meters (when fully extended)
- Weight: 3-5 kg (hollow bones, lightweight structure)
- Lifespan: Unknown (estimated 15-20 years based on growth rate)

**Distinctive Features:**

**Bioluminescent Wing Patterns**
- Complex geometric patterns across wing membranes
- Coloration: Deep cyan to electric blue (varies by individual)
- Pattern structure: Resembles old-world circuit diagrams and signal waveforms
- Glow intensity: Variable, increases near active electronic equipment

**Chitinous Plating**
- Small, overlapping scales along spine and head
- Color: Metallic gray with Signal-frequency iridescence
- Function: Provides limited protection, primarily serves as Signal receptor array

**Sensory Organs**
- Large, faceted eyes (nocturnal adaptation)
- Antennae-like growths behind jawline (Signal detection)
- Specialized tongue for "tasting" electromagnetic frequencies

**Anomalous Properties:**
- Wing patterns pulse in rhythm with nearby Signal transmissions
- Body temperature fluctuates with Signal intensity
- Shed scales retain faint luminescence for 48 hours
- Blood shows mild phosphorescent properties

> **Field Note:** "The patterns on its wings aren't just pretty lights. Watch them long enough and you'll start seeing data—old transmission fragments, corrupted packets, fragments of voices from before. It's like the drake is wearing the Signal on its skin."

## BEHAVIORAL ANALYSIS

### Signal Attraction Behavior

The defining characteristic of the Signal-Drake is its instinctive attraction to electronic signals and radio transmissions. This behavior shapes every aspect of its existence.

**Attraction Hierarchy:**

| Signal Type | Response Intensity | Observed Behavior |
|-------------|-------------------|-------------------|
| Active comms arrays | Extreme | Circling, wing display, vocalization |
| Portable radios | High | Approach within 2m, antennae extension |
| Signal detectors | Moderate | Curious investigation, possible interference |
| Dormant electronics | Low | Brief inspection, rapid disinterest |
| Absentee control signals | Variable | Can disrupt or amplify depending on drake's mood |

**Signal Manipulation Capabilities:**

**Disruption Mode**
- Range: 10m radius
- Effect: 25% chance to jam unshielded communications
- Duration: As long as drake remains agitated
- Manifestation: Wing patterns flash rapidly, accompanied by high-frequency chirping

**Amplification Mode**
- Range: 20m directional cone
- Effect: Boosts weak signals to usable strength
- Duration: Concentrated effort, 30-60 seconds maximum
- Manifestation: Drone becomes motionless, wings fully extended, steady glow

### Social Behavior

**Solitary Nature**
- Hatchlings leave nest within 3 months of birth
- Adults tolerate proximity only during mating season
- Territory size: Approximately 2km radius per individual

**Communication**
- Complex vocal repertoire (ultrasonic and audible)
- Wing pattern displays for territorial disputes
- Signal-frequency "songs" during courtship

**Intelligence Indicators:**
- Tool use: Observed using debris to manipulate environment
- Problem-solving: Can navigate simple puzzles for food rewards
- Memory: Recognizes individual absentees across multiple encounters
- Learning: Responds to consistent training patterns within 2-3 weeks

### Bonding Potential

The Signal-Drake represents one of the few specimens in the Deep Ruins capable of forming genuine bonds with observers.

**Bonding Requirements:**
- Consistent positive interaction over 10-14 days
- Regular provision of preferred food (Signal-Resonant Fungus, synthetic protein)
- Respect for drake's personal space (forced contact triggers defensive behavior)
- Exposure to absentee's personal communication frequency (drake learns to recognize "friend" signal)

**Bonded Behavior Changes:**
- Ceases disruptive interference with bonded absentee's equipment
- Actively amplifies bonded absentee's signals when distressed
- Defensive displays toward threats to bonded partner
- Willingness to enter confined spaces (backpacks, small shelters) when bonded absentee travels

> **Research Note:** "The bonding process isn't dominance. It's negotiation. The drake chooses you, not the other way around. And once it chooses, that connection is real. I've seen them throw themselves between their bonded partner and a Void Crawler. That's not instinct—that's loyalty."

## FIELD NOTES & ENCOUNTERS

### Discovery — Bioengineer Voss (Year 5, Day 112)

> *"I was calibrating the relay array at Station 4 when the interference started. My signal detector went haywire, readings spiking in patterns I'd never seen. Then I saw it—perched on the transmission tower, wings spread wide, glowing like a living circuit board."
>
> *"It didn't flee when I approached. Just watched me with those faceted eyes, head tilted like it was trying to figure me out. When I held up my portable comm unit, it chirped and the patterns on its wings changed—started pulsing in time with my device's heartbeat signal."
>
> *"I spent three hours observing it. When I left, it followed me to the station perimeter. That's when I knew I'd found something special."*

**Significance:** First confirmed sighting of *Draco Telemetrica* juvenile. Prior rumors of "ghost lights" in the Deep Ruins now attributed to this species.

### The Interference Incident — Scavenger Team Delta (Year 6, Day 78)

A Signal-Drake hatchling took up residence near a scavenger camp operating in Zone B7.

**Initial Phase (Days 1-5):**
- Drake observed at distance, no interference noted
- Team members reported "pretty lights" during night watches
- Equipment functioned normally

**Escalation Phase (Days 6-12):**
- Drake approached camp, began investigating equipment
- Communications became unreliable (static, dropped transmissions)
- Signal detectors showed phantom readings

**Crisis Phase (Day 13):**
- Emergency extraction call failed due to drake interference
- Team trapped overnight when closing protocols malfunctioned
- One scavenger attempted to drive drake away with weapon fire

**Resolution:**
Drake responded to aggression with amplification burst, temporarily boosting the camp's emergency beacon to levels detectable by Terminal 7-B. Rescue team arrived within 4 hours. Drake fled during rescue operation.

**After-Action Assessment:** "The damn thing nearly got us killed, then saved our lives. I'm not sure if that makes it a menace or a guardian spirit." — Team Leader, Scavenger Delta

### Taming Experiment — Bioengineer Voss (Year 7, Days 45-90)

45-day controlled bonding attempt with captured hatchling (designated "Spark").

**Week 1-2: Acclimation**
- Drake displayed fear responses to confinement
- Refused food, showed stress behaviors (rapid wing flashing)
- Released into larger enclosure with Signal source (old radio)

**Week 3-4: Trust Building**
- Drake began accepting food from Voss's hand
- First voluntary approach within 1m
- Interference with Voss's equipment ceased

**Week 5-6: Bond Formation**
- Drake responded to Voss's whistle with specific wing pattern
- Amplification behavior triggered when Voss simulated distress signal
- First successful "recall" command (drake returned to enclosure on signal)

**Results:** Successful bond established. Specimen demonstrated loyalty behaviors, protective instincts, and utility as living signal amplifier.

> **Research Log:** "Spark isn't a pet. I want to be clear about that. She's a partner. She chooses to stay with me, chooses to help. I can see the intelligence in her eyes when she looks at me—not the blank stare of a trained animal, but something more. Something aware."  
> — Voss, Final Report

### The Parent Encounter — T3 Expedition (Year 8, Day 203)

Recovery team searching for lost scavengers encountered adult Signal-Drake (presumed parent of SPEC-031 population).

**Observation Log:**
- Wingspan estimated at 4+ meters
- Signal interference radius: 50m+
- Amplification burst knocked out expedition communications for 6 minutes
- Displayed territorial aggression when approached

**Casualties:** 2 absentees severely damaged (equipment failure during retreat)  
**Survivors:** 4 team members (emergency manual extraction)  
**Assessment:** Adult specimens classified as T5 Threat Level. Juvenile acquisition protocols must avoid parent territories.

## ZONE DISTRIBUTION

| Zone | Encounter Rate | Notes |
|------|----------------|-------|
| B7 (Deep Ruins - Comms Sector) | Common (35%) | Primary habitat, multiple nesting sites |
| C3 (Relay Network) | Uncommon (15%) | Transit corridor, no permanent populations |
| D2 (Old World Infrastructure) | Rare (8%) | Occasional strays, poor survival rate |
| E5 (The Gaps) | Very Rare (3%) | Stress environment, specimens usually injured |

**Breeding Grounds:**
Confirmed nesting sites located near:
- Relay Station 4 (Zone B7)
- Array Sector 7-B (Zone B7)
- The Hollow Tower (Zone C3) — *caution: T5 parent territory*

**Access Requirements:**
- T2 Clearance for general observation
- T3 Clearance for specimen collection
- Breeding program participation requires T4 + sponsorship

**Environmental Context:**
Signal-Drakes require environments with consistent Signal presence. They cannot survive in dead zones (Signal intensity <10%) for more than 72 hours. Specimens removed from Signal-rich environments show rapid health decline.

## TERMINAL 7-B ARCHIVE ADDENDUM

> *"Bioengineer Voss brought Spark to the Terminal last month. I'd read the reports, seen the footage, but nothing prepares you for meeting one in person. The way it looked at me—really looked, like it was sizing me up, deciding if I was worth knowing."
>
> *"Voss says Spark can tell when someone's being truthful. The wing patterns change when she detects stress in a person's voice. We've started using that. Nothing formal, just... when someone comes in claiming they found something valuable, we let Spark take a look at them first. She's never been wrong."
>
> *"I keep thinking about what these creatures mean. They're drawn to the Signal like moths to flame, but they don't burn. They thrive in it. The same Signal that mutates everything else, drives people mad, turns the world into a nightmare—these little drakes treat it like sunshine."
>
> *"Are they adapted to the Signal? Or were they made for it? Voss found genetic markers that don't match anything in our pre-Event databases. Either they're new, or they're something old that we forgot."
>
> *"Spark sits on Voss's shoulder during the daily briefings now. When the Signal interference gets bad—when the static rises and the voices start—her wings glow brighter. Not a warning. A comfort. Like she's saying, 'I hear it too, and it's okay.'"
>
> *"I applied for the breeding program waitlist yesterday. 18 months. I can wait."*
>

## GM NOTES (INTERNAL)

The Signal-Drake Hatchling serves multiple design purposes:

**Companion Mechanics:**
- Provides mechanical benefits (signal amplification, detection)
- Requires ongoing investment (food, care, attention)
- Creates emotional attachment through bonding mechanics
- Death or loss carries meaningful consequence

**Lore Integration:**
- Connects to the Signal's nature—creatures that thrive rather than suffer
- Implies engineered origin (pre-Event bioengineering project?)
- Offers hope: life adapts, finds a way, builds connections

**Risk/Reward Balance:**
- High initial investment justifies significant utility
- Bonding time requirement prevents immediate power gain
- Vulnerability (small, fragile) maintains tension

**Player Agency:**
- Multiple acquisition paths support different playstyles
- Bonded drake can be customized (name, training focus)
- Moral choice: wild freedom vs. domestic partnership

**Narrative Hooks:**
- Parent drake encounters create T5-level challenges
- Breeding program politics (Terminal 7-B factions)
- Signal-Drake illness requires quest for rare medicine
- Lost bonded drake rescue missions
