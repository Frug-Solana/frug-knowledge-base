# Specimens: Apex Predators

## Shadow Stalker

**Relationship:** EC-001 - Active Predation of Bog Hoppers

Shadow Stalkers are highly coordinated pack hunters that primarily target Bog Hoppers during twilight hours. Their chase patterns reveal sophisticated pack coordination that suggests elevated cognitive function.

**Behavior Notes:**
- Hunt primarily during twilight hours
- Exhibit sophisticated pack coordination
- Prey mainly on Bog Hoppers

## Apex Glimmer

**Relationship:** EC-003 - Apex Predator of the island ecosystem

The Apex Glimmer sits at the absolute top of the food chain. This specimen has been observed hunting Shadow Stalkers, Terror Birds, and even challenging the massive Verdant Colossi.

**Behavior Notes:**
- Hunts Shadow Stalkers
- Preys on Terror Birds
- Challenges Verdant Colossi
- No natural predators documented

## Shadow Jaguar

**ID:** wild-jaguar  
**Name:** Shadow Jaguar  
**Variant:** C-47 (Red)  
**First Documented:** Year 8  
**Population:** 1-3 estimated  
**Threat Level:** HIGH

**Notes:** Apex predator of the deep woods. Rarely seen, often felt. Subject of ghost stories among the surviving documentation teams. The cognitive enhancement from C-47 makes these jaguars exceptionally stealthy and intelligent hunters.

## Armored Rhino

**ID:** wild-rhino  
**Name:** Armored Rhino  
**Variant:** L-19 (Yellow) extreme  
**First Documented:** Year 10  
**Population:** Single specimen suspected  
**Threat Level:** HIGH (Territorial)

**Notes:** Skin has calcified into near-organic concrete. Immune to tranquilizers. The extreme L-19 variant has created a virtually indestructible outer layer. Extremely territorial - approach with extreme caution.
