# Specimens: Forest

## Queen of Shadows (Sable Fox)

**ID:** sable-fox  
**Name:** Queen of Shadows  
**Variant:** C-47 (Red) pure  
**First Documented:** Year 1, Month 6 (FR-003)  
**Population:** 1 documented  
**Threat Level:** UNKNOWN  
**Territory:** x: 42, y: 58, range: 8

**Observations:** 365 documented  
**Last Sighting:** Year 15, Month 1 (nightly visits)

**Discovery Report (FR-003):**

> "Dusk. Motion sensor didn't trigger. But I SAW her. A fox. Jet black. Larger than baseline. Watching from exactly 40 feet away.
> 
> I checked the sensor logs. She's been there before. Same spot. Same time. Every night for the past week. HOW DID SHE KNOW THE RANGE?
> 
> Pure C-47 Red. Cognitive enhancement in an apex predator. She's studying me. Learning my patterns. The same way I'm studying specimens."

**Behavioral Notes:**
- Maintains exactly 40-foot distance from Frugowski at all times
- Studies Frugowski, learning his patterns
- Annual midnight visit tradition (New Year's)
- Recognizes and avoids motion sensors
- Demonstrates exceptional intelligence and pattern recognition

**Frugowski's Assessment:** "We have an understanding now. She watches. I document. Neither of us leaves."

## Verdant Colossi

**ID:** verdant-colossus  
**Name:** Verdant Colossi  
**Variant:** B-12X (Green) pure  
**First Documented:** Year 2, Month 1  
**Population:** 50+  
**Threat Level:** LOW (unless provoked)  
**Territory:** x: 25, y: 30, range: 12

**Observations:** 30 documented  
**Last Sighting:** Year 15, Month 1

**Notes:** Massive specimens reaching 20-40 feet in height. Pure B-12X variant has created plant-based organisms with tree-like characteristics. Communicate through root networks and form cooperative groves.

**Ecosystem Role:** Symbiotic with smaller creatures - provide shelter in their bark (EC-006). New grove formed near Agricultural Sector as of Year 15.

**Predator Relationship:** Apex Glimmer has been observed challenging Verdant Colossi.

## Wraith Weaver

**Relationship:** EC-008 - Parasitic feeding on pheromone emissions

Wraith Weavers feed on the pheromone emissions of other specimens. They don't kill their prey but can significantly weaken them through sustained feeding.

**Behavior Notes:**
- Parasitic relationship with multiple species
- Feed on pheromone emissions
- Weaken prey without killing
- May contribute to hybrid degradation over time

## Arboreal Hoarder

**ID:** wild-squirrel  
**Name:** Arboreal Hoarder  
**Variant:** Normal (no significant mutation detected)  
**First Documented:** Year 1  
**Population:** High  
**Threat Level:** PASSIVE

**Notes:** Show higher than average intelligence in food storage patterns. Despite no pharmaceutical variant signature, these squirrels demonstrate enhanced problem-solving abilities, possibly through environmental exposure.

## Forest Ecosystem Summary

The forest zones of Degenora contain some of the most cognitively enhanced specimens due to C-47 concentrations. The Queen of Shadows represents the pinnacle of cognitive enhancement in a pure predator form, while Verdant Colossi demonstrate the plant-adaptation potential of B-12X.
