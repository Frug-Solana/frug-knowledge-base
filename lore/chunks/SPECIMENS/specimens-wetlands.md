# Specimens: Wetlands

## Bog Hoppers

**ID:** bog-hopper  
**Variant:** B-12X (Green) + L-19 (Yellow)  
**First Documented:** Year 1, Month 2 (Fr-001)  
**Population:** 1,000+  
**Threat Level:** MODERATE  
**Territory:** x: 35, y: 72, range: 10

**Observations:** 89 documented  
**Last Sighting:** Year 15, Month 1

**Notes:** Territorial but not aggressive. Capable of 50+ feet jumping. Complex vocal patterns. Primary food source is Luminescent Larvae (EC-004), creating a cycle of pharmaceutical concentration through the Green Pond ecosystem.

**Predator Relationship:** Shadow Stalkers hunt Bog Hoppers during twilight hours (EC-001).

## Deep Dwellers

**ID:** deep-dweller  
**Variant:** A-02 (Blue) pure  
**First Documented:** Year 3, Month 5  
**Population:** Unknown (rarely surface)  
**Threat Level:** UNKNOWN  
**Territory:** x: 85, y: 70, range: 15

**Observations:** 12 documented  
**Last Sighting:** Year 15, Month 3

**Notes:** Pure A-02 variant enables deep aquatic existence. Full moon surfacing events feature haunting songs and pod behavior. Deep Dwellers exhibit coordinated chorus behavior that may represent communication or ritual.

**Significant Event:** Year 15, Month 3 - Full moon chorus lasted two hours with Tide Walkers joining at the shoreline. Frugowski documented: "They remember being human. They remember music. This is how they remember."

## Tide Walkers

**ID:** tide-walker  
**Variant:** A-02 (Blue) + B-12X (Green)  
**First Documented:** Year 2, Month 8  
**Population:** 80+  
**Threat Level:** LOW  
**Territory:** x: 80, y: 75, range: 10

**Observations:** 45 documented  
**Last Sighting:** Year 15, Month 3

**Notes:** Amphibious specimens with hybrid aquatic-terrestrial capabilities. Curious about Terminal 7-B broadcasts. Join Deep Dweller choruses during full moon events.

**Behavior:** Exhibit coordinated hunting during high tide, trapping prey in tidal pools (EC-005).

## Sludge Crawlers

**ID:** sludge-crawler  
**Variant:** B-12X (Green) pure  
**First Documented:** Year 3, Month 9  
**Population:** 300+  
**Threat Level:** PASSIVE  
**Territory:** x: 38, y: 68, range: 6

**Observations:** 8 documented  
**Last Sighting:** Year 14, Month 6

**Notes:** Critical ecosystem role as filter and decomposer. Sludge Crawlers break down deceased specimens and plant matter, recycling pharmaceutical compounds back into the environment. Sessile (stationary) specimens that filter contaminated water - beneficial to overall ecosystem health.

## Macro-Gastropod

**ID:** wild-snail  
**Name:** Macro-Gastropod  
**Variant:** B-12X  
**First Documented:** Year 2  
**Population:** Common near water  
**Threat Level:** PASSIVE

**Notes:** Shells exhibit fractal patterns. Mucus is highly acidic. B-12X variant has significantly altered shell formation and chemical composition.

## Wetland Ecosystem Summary

The wetlands represent one of the most pharmaceutically concentrated zones on Degenora. The Green Pond serves as both feeding ground and transformation catalyst, with specimens exhibiting diverse adaptations to aquatic and semi-aquatic life.
