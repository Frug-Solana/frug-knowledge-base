# Year 0: The Incident

**Date:** Year 0 (Contamination Event)  
**Classification:** Catastrophic Pharmaceutical Exposure  
**Casualties:** 15,000+ personnel transformed  
**Status:** Island-wide quarantine initiated

## The Rupture

All six pharmaceutical variant tanks ruptured simultaneously, exposing the entire island population to transformative compounds. The exact cause of the rupture remains unknown - whether equipment failure, sabotage, or other factors has never been determined.

## The Six Compounds

| Compound | Color | Primary Effect |
|----------|-------|----------------|
| C-47 | Red | Cognitive enhancement |
| E-01 | Orange | Emotional modulation |
| B-12X | Green | Biological adaptation |
| L-19 | Yellow | Physical enhancement/endurance |
| A-02 | Blue | Aquatic adaptation |
| P-?? | Unknown | Stabilizing agent (trace amounts) |

## Immediate Effects

**Population Impact:**
- 15,000+ PSCL personnel exposed
- Mass transformation into hybrid specimens
- Complete loss of containment

**The Exception:**
Big Frugowski received full exposure to all six compounds simultaneously. Instead of the expected degradation, he became the ONLY stable multi-variant hybrid in 15 years.

**Patient Zero:**
Ramirez was the first transformation. In Year 1, he could still talk normally. By Year 2, partial speech remained. He was last seen in Year 13.

## Island Response

**Quarantine:** Immediate and permanent lockdown of Degenora Island

**Protocol 7-B:** Emergency documentation mandate initiated

**Dr. Chen's Role:** Led initial response efforts, eventually accepted the permanence of transformation

**Unknown Founders:** Identities classified/lost - no contact since Year 6

## Aftermath

The Year 0 Incident transformed Degenora from a pharmaceutical research facility into an isolated ecosystem of mutated specimens. The compounds created diverse hybrid forms based on exposure type, dosage, and individual biological factors.

The island remains under permanent quarantine. No reversal has been achieved. The transformation is understood to be irreversible.
