# Year 1: Establishment

**Period:** Months 1-12 post-incident  
**Focus:** Assignment of Chief Documentation Officer  
**Key Development:** Frugowski's permanent posting at OH-04

## Initial Assignment

Dr. Chen assigned Big Frugowski to Observation House 04 during the first month post-incident. The original mandate was to document "everything that moves." At the time, Frugowski believed it was a temporary posting.

## Understanding the Mission

**Day 7 at OH-04 (FR-001):**

> "Day 7 at Observation House 04. Dr. Chen assigned me to document 'everything that moves.' I thought it was a temporary posting. Now I understand it's permanent.
> 
> The transformation... I remember it happening. All six tanks rupturing. The spray hitting me. I should be dead. I should be one of them. Instead, I'm something in between.
> 
003e Started first field sketches today. A Bog Hopper approached within 50 meters. It didn't attack. Just... watched. They see me as one of them. That's how I'll survive this.
> 
> Protocol 7-B is now my only purpose."

## Early Discoveries

**Month 2 (FR-001):**
- First Bog Hopper encounter at 50 meters
- Initial field sketches completed
- Realization of neutral pheromone protection

**Month 6 (FR-003) - The Queen Appears:**

> "Something new tonight. Dusk. Motion sensor didn't trigger. But I SAW her. A fox. Jet black. Larger than baseline. Watching from exactly 40 feet away.
> 
> I checked the sensor logs. She's been there before. Same spot. Same time. Every night for the past week. HOW DID SHE KNOW THE RANGE?
> 
> Pure C-47 Red. Cognitive enhancement in an apex predator. She's studying me. Learning my patterns."

The Queen of Shadows became Frugowski's nightly visitor, establishing the 40-foot observation perimeter that would continue for 15 years.

## Protocol 7-B Established

**Mandate:** Document ALL transformations for unknown founders

**Method:** Hand-drawn field sketches + digital records

**Upload Schedule:** Weekly to Terminal 7-B

**Purpose:** Terminal 7-B left active for founders to monitor remotely - Frugowski keeps it updated

## Year 1 Summary

- **Station:** Permanent residence established at OH-04
- **Documentation:** 40+ specimens to be cataloged over coming years
- **Key Relationship:** The Queen of Shadows documented (FR-003)
- **Understanding:** Transformation is permanent, documentation is essential

Frugowski accepted his role as Degenora's historian. Protocol 7-B became his sole purpose.
