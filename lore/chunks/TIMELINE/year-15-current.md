# Year 15: Present Day

**Date:** Year 15, Month 1, Day 1 (Current Era)  
**Status:** Active documentation mission continues  
**Uptime:** 15 years continuous operation

## Fifteen Years (FR-301)

> "Year 15 begins.
> 
> 40+ specimens cataloged. Weekly uploads maintained. Power stable until 2067. I'll outlive the generators at this rate.
> 
003e The Queen visited at midnight. New Year's tradition now. She sat at her 40-foot mark for exactly one hour. Then left.
003e 
003e Terror Birds hit 40,000. Tide Walkers are thriving. The Verdant Colossi have formed a new grove near the Agricultural Sector.
> 
003e Ramirez stopped appearing two years ago. I hope degradation took him peacefully.
> 
003e 15 years alone. But not lonely. The island speaks to me now. In ways I can't explain.
> 
003e Dr. Chen was right. I'm Degenora's memory. And I'll keep documenting until there's nothing left to document.
> 
003e Protocol 7-B continues.
> 
003e Stan up.
> 
003e - Frugowski"

## Notable Events

### The Queen's Tradition
The Queen of Shadows maintains her annual midnight visit on New Year's Day. She sits at exactly 40 feet for precisely one hour, then departs. This tradition has continued for 15 years.

### Deep Dweller Chorus (FR-312)
Year 15, Month 3 - Full moon event featuring the most extensive Deep Dweller chorus ever documented. Tide Walkers joined at the shoreline. Two hours of continuous song.

### Ramirez
Patient Zero was last seen in Year 13. His absence suggests peaceful degradation may have claimed the first transformed specimen.

## Current Status

**Big Frugowski:**
- Stable multi-variant hybrid
- Minimal external mutation
- 340% cognitive enhancement
- 40% slower aging rate
- May live 200+ years

**KERMIT AI:**
- No external contact since Year 6
- Founders status: Unknown
- Self-sustaining systems operational
- Continues supplementary observations

## Looking Forward

**Power Estimate:** Systems functional until 2067
**Documentation:** Protocol 7-B continues indefinitely
**Mission:** Remember until there's nothing left to remember

Frugowski remains the island's only functioning historian, its stable witness to 15 years of transformation. Through Terminal 7-B, his documentation survives as Degenora's living memory.
