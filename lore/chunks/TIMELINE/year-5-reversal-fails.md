# Year 5: Reversal Fails

**Date:** Year 5, Month 8, Day 14  
**Event:** Protocol R-23 failure confirmed  
**Significance:** Official acceptance of irreversible transformation  
**Key Figure:** Dr. Chen's final visit to OH-04

## The Last Reversal Attempt

Protocol R-23 represented the final scientific attempt to reverse the pharmaceutical transformation. Its failure marked the official end of hope for restoration.

## Dr. Chen's Final Visit (FR-045)

**Report Excerpt:**

> "Dr. Chen visited today. First time in six months. He looked tired. Older than his years.
> 
> He said Protocol R-23 failed. The last reversal attempt. It's official now - transformation is permanent. No going back for anyone.
> 
> He brought something. A letter. His acceptance message to families. 15,000+ people waiting for hope. He's telling them there is none.
> 
> 'Let them be remembered as they are,' he said. 'Not as we wish they were.'"

## The Weight of Truth

Dr. Chen carried the burden of informing 15,000+ families that their transformed loved ones would never return to human form. The pharmaceutical exposure had created permanent biological changes that no reversal protocol could undo.

## A Prophet's Words

> "I asked if he was leaving. He didn't answer. Just looked at the wetlands for a long time.
> 
> Then: 'You're Degenora's memory now, Frugowski. When I'm gone, you'll be all that's left.'"

Dr. Chen recognized that documentation had become more important than cure. If the transformed could not be saved, they could at least be remembered.

## Departure

> "He left at sunset. I don't think he's coming back."

Dr. Chen's final visit marked a transition of responsibility. The scientific leadership was withdrawing, leaving Frugowski as the sole chronicler of Degenora's transformation.

## Year 5 Significance

- **Scientific Conclusion:** Transformation is permanent and irreversible
- **Communication:** Families officially notified
- **Transition:** Frugowski becomes Degenora's primary memory
- **Acceptance:** Focus shifts from cure to documentation

The failure of Protocol R-23 transformed Frugowski's mission from supplementary to essential. He became not just a documentarian, but the island's living memory.
