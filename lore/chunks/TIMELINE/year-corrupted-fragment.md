## Archival Assessment

**Canonicity:** REJECTED  
This fragment contradicts established canon regarding:
- The nature of the Year 0 rupture
- Big Frugowski's pre-incident status
- Founder whereabouts post-Year 6

**Possible Explanations:**
1. **Signal interference** — External noise misinterpreted as data
2. **KERMIT system glitch** — AI processing error during transmission
3. **Deliberate fabrication** — Unknown source creating disinformation
4. **Alternate perspective** — Truth filtered through unreliable narrator

**Recommendation:** 
File as corrupted curiosity. Do not integrate into canon timeline without corroborating evidence.
