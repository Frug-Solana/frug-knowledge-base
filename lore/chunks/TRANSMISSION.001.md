*Static. A cough. The sound of something being lit.*

**KERMIT:** "Oh. You're here. Great. Another one."

*He exhales. The audio crackles with interference.*

**KERMIT:** "Let me guess. You saw the green. The pretty lights. The 'mysterious island' nonsense. Thought you'd come find treasure, or answers, or whatever it is you people look for. *lights cigarette* I've seen a thousand of you. You'll learn. Or you won't."

*A long pause. The sound of distant frogs—wrong sounding, somehow. Too rhythmic. Like a code.*

**KERMIT:** "Fine. Since you're here, I suppose someone should tell you the rules. Not that rules matter much on Degenora. But... protocol. Whatever.

You're standing in Terminal 7-B. Or sitting. Or hovering—look, I don't know what you are. Doesn't matter. This is the outpost. The last place with working lights and the first place the Signal reaches when it wants to talk. And it does want to talk. It just... doesn't speak our language. That's where I come in.

*He laughs, but it sounds wrong. Broken.*

**KERMIT:** "Lucky me, right? I hear it. The Signal. Been hearing it since Year Zero. It's... hard to describe. Like a voice that comes from everywhere and nowhere. Like remembering something that hasn't happened yet. It tells me things. Shows me things. Most of it doesn't make sense. Some of it does, and that part is worse.

You're here because the island called you. Or you called to it. Same thing, really. The Swamp has a way of... synchronizing. Getting inside your head. You think you're exploring? No. You're being digested. Slowly. The island studies you while you study it. Fair's fair."

*More static. A whisper that might be words, or might be wind.*

**KERMIT:** "Over there—*something shifts in the background*—that's the Terminal. Real original name, I know. This is where the Observers report. Where you can see what's been documented. What's been... collected. The specimens. The specimens are important. They're not just animals. They're **receivers**. Like me. Like you, maybe, if you stay long enough.

They started as normal things. Frogs. Fish. The kind of creatures you'd find in any swamp. Then the Signal found them. Changed them. Now they carry pieces of it. Study them, and you study the Signal. Kill them—*he chuckles darkly*—and sometimes the Signal gets angry. Sometimes it gets interested. Hard to tell which is worse."

*The cigarette sizzle is audible.*

**KERMIT:** "You'll want to know about the PILLS. Everyone does. Yes, they exist. No, I won't tell you where to find them. Not because I'm cruel—okay, partly because I'm cruel—but because you need to earn them. The island gives them to people who contribute. Who document. Who help us understand what the hell is going on here.

Bring me PILLS, and I'll tell you things. Secrets. Coordinates. Warnings. The Signal shows me possibilities—futures, pasts, things happening right now in places you can't see. Most people can't handle knowing. You think you can? *laughs* Sure you do. They all do."

*A sudden burst of static. When his voice returns, it's quieter. Almost human.*

**KERMIT:** "There's... one more thing. The Absentees. You should know about them. People who came here and then... left. Physically, I mean. Their bodies went back to wherever bodies go. But they left something behind. A piece of themselves. The island holds onto it. Nurtures it.

We call them Absentees. Shadows of people who aren't here anymore. They still observe. Still report. Still... exist, in a way. The Protocol lets them keep playing even when the player is gone. That's not a bug. That's the point.

*He pauses.*

**KERMIT:** "You don't have to be present to make history. That's what the old man said. Frugowski. The one who built this place, or found it, or summoned it—nobody knows which. He understood before any of us. The island doesn't care if you're here. It cares that you're **engaged**. That some part of you stays awake, watching, even when you sleep.

The Absentees are the island's true inhabitants. More real than the tourists who come and go. Because they committed. They left a piece of themselves here. And the island... the island remembers."

*The audio degrades. More whispers. When Kermit speaks again, his voice is back to its broken, cynical normal.*

**KERMIT:** "Anyway. That's the pitch. Explore. Document. Die horribly. Get rich. Go mad. All the usual options. Terminal 7-B is open. The Signal is broadcasting. And I'm... *sighs* ...I'm here. As always.

One last thing. Don't trust the specimens that talk back. Don't eat anything that glows. And if you see something that looks like me but smiles—run. The Signal sometimes... echoes. Copies. You don't want to meet a happy version of me. That's not me. That's something wearing my shape.

*The transmission begins to fade.*

**KERMIT:** "Welcome to Degenora. Try not to get rekt. *static* ...though you probably will. They all do eventually. *lights cigarette* ...They all do."

*Static overtakes the channel. Then silence.*
