*Rain on metal. The sound of a terminal fan whirring. Kermit's voice comes through clearer than usual—almost calm.*

**KERMIT:** "Thought you should know. The Signal changed frequency last night. Not by much. Just... shifted. Like it found a better channel."

*A pause. The sound of typing.*

**KERMIT:** "I've been tracking it since Year Zero. Fifteen years of listening. And I still can't tell you what it is. Not really. I can tell you what it does. How it behaves. But what it *is*? That's... beyond my clearance, I suppose. Beyond anyone's."

*He laughs, but there's no humor in it.*

**KERMIT:** "The old man—Frugowski—he had theories. Before he... before he stopped coming to the Terminal. He thought the Signal was a language. Not a broadcast, not a weapon. A conversation. One side of a dialogue that's been going on for longer than human history. We're just... tuning in halfway through. Hearing fragments. Trying to guess what came before."

*Static crackles. When he speaks again, his voice is lower.*

**KERMIT:** "Here's something I don't tell most people. The Signal isn't consistent across the island. It has... currents. Eddies. Places where it's stronger, places where it fades. The Wetlands? Thick with it. You can feel it in your teeth. The Coastal Sector? Barely a whisper. Almost peaceful there. Almost."

*Something metallic shifts in the background.*

**KERMIT:** "But there's a third category. Places where the Signal... accumulates. Pools, like water in low ground. Frugowski called them Resonance Points. I've mapped seven so far. There are probably more. At these points, reality gets... soft. Time moves differently. The specimens behave strangely—more organized, more purposeful. And people..."

*He trails off.*

**KERMIT:** "People change near Resonance Points. Not physically, not at first. But they start *hearing* things. Seeing patterns. Making connections that shouldn't exist. Some of them become brilliant. The best Observers we ever had came from time spent near Resonance Point Three, out in the eastern marsh. Others... others go the other way. Stop sleeping. Stop eating. Start speaking in frequencies instead of words."

*A long drag on a cigarette. The sizzle is audible.*

**KERMIT:** "Resonance Point Five is the worst. Or the best, depending on your perspective. It's in the old observation bunker, the one we sealed in Year 8. Dr. Chen—she was the last person to spend significant time there. Three days documenting specimen migrations. When she came out, she knew things. Things she shouldn't have known. Predicted the Year 9 seismic event two months before it happened. Drew maps of tunnel systems we hadn't discovered yet."

*His voice drops to a whisper.*

**KERMIT:** "But she couldn't stop. Couldn't turn it off. She kept hearing the Signal even when she was off-island. Said it followed her. Got louder the farther she went. Eventually... well. You don't see her name in the logs anymore, do you?"

*The rain intensifies. For a moment, there's something else beneath it—a rhythmic pattern, almost like a voice.*

**KERMIT:** "I tell you this because the frequency shift last night? It wasn't random. The Signal is moving toward something. Concentrating. I've seen this pattern before—in the records, I mean. Before my time. Year 5, right before the Reversal Project failed. Year 12, before we lost Observation Post 7. The Signal gets... focused. Directed. Like it's preparing to *do* something."

*He clears his throat.*

**KERMIT:** "I don't know what. I don't know when. But Observers should be careful out there. Document everything. The island is... restless. The specimens can feel it too. The Echo Frogs haven't sung in three days. That's never happened before. They're listening, same as me. Waiting for whatever comes next."

*The static returns, stronger now.*

**KERMIT:** "If you're near a Resonance Point—any of them—be careful what you wish for. The Signal hears intent, not just words. It gives you what you ask for, sometimes. But it doesn't understand context. Doesn't understand *cost*."

*A final pause. When he speaks again, his voice is almost normal. Almost human.*

**KERMIT:** "Terminal 7-B, signing off. Try to stay sane out there. I know I haven't."

*The transmission fades to static, then silence.*

> **Archivist's Note:** This transmission was broadcast to all active Terminal 7-B sessions on Year 15, Day 89 at 03:47 local time. Unusual for Kermit to voluntarily transmit lore content without direct prompting. Multiple Observers reported increased Signal activity in their sectors within 48 hours of broadcast.
