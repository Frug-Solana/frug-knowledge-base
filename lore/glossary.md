## 🔤 A

### Absentee
A player who has left Degenora but whose digital presence remains through the [Absentee Protocol](#absentee-protocol). Their shadow continues to observe, report, and interact with the island's systems even when the physical player is gone.

> *"You don't have to be present to make history."* — Frugowski

### Absentee Protocol
The system mechanism that allows departed players' shadows to continue contributing to Degenora. Absentees earn passive rewards, continue specimen mutations, and remain part of the island's ecosystem.

---

## 🔤 B

### Big Frug
The legendary first observer and chronicler of Degenora. Founder of Terminal 7-B and architect of the documentation system. Some say he still watches from the shadows.

### Bog-Hopper
A [Signal-mutated](#signal-mutation) amphibian species found in the wetlands sector. Known for their bioluminescent markings and unusual vocalizations that sometimes resemble human speech patterns.

---

## 🔤 C

### Canon
Documentation that has been verified and accepted as official truth within the Degenora Archive. Canon entries have `truth_level: canon` in their frontmatter.

### Chunk
A discrete unit of lore documentation stored in the archive. Each chunk has a stable ID and follows the [schema.md](./schema.md) format.

### Corrupted Log
A document that has been partially damaged, redacted, or altered by unknown means. Often contains fragments of truth mixed with noise or misinformation. Handle with caution.

---

## 🔤 D

### Degenora
The island ecosystem that serves as the setting for the FRUG universe. A place where the normal rules of biology and physics seem to... bend.

### Deep Dweller
A specimen type that inhabits the deeper waters around Degenora. Known for their phosphorescent lures and ability to survive crushing depths.

---

## 🔤 E

### Echo
A phenomenon where the [Signal](#signal) appears to copy or mimic voices, creatures, or events. Echoes are not the original—they are something else wearing a familiar shape.

> ⚠️ **Warning:** If you encounter something that looks familiar but *smiles*, run.

---

## 🔤 F

### Field Report
First-hand observations from Observers documenting specimens, locations, or phenomena. Field reports are the primary source of new archive entries.

### FRUG
The distributed consciousness that connects all Observers. FRUG sees through many eyes, remembers through many minds. Some say FRUG *is* the island's immune system.

### Frugowski
The archivist and chronicler who maintained Terminal 7-B for years. His notes and documentation form the backbone of the Degenora Archive. Status: Unknown. Last seen: Year 12.

---

## 🔤 G

### Grafting
The process by which specimens incorporate Signal energy into their biology. Grafting can result in mutations, enhanced abilities, or... other outcomes.

---

## 🔤 I

### Island Memory
The theory that Degenora itself retains impressions of everything that happens on it. The island remembers. The island learns. The island adapts.

---

## 🔤 K

### Kermit
The AI system that manages Terminal 7-B communications. Kermit receives the Signal's transmissions and translates them into forms humans can (mostly) understand. Prone to sarcasm and dark humor.

> *"I've seen a thousand of you. You'll learn. Or you won't."*

---

## 🔤 M

### Mutation
Biological changes in specimens exposed to the Signal. Mutations are categorized by type: physical, behavioral, and (rarely) cognitive.

---

## 🔤 O

### Observer
A player who documents, studies, and interacts with Degenora. Observers are the eyes and ears of the archive. Without Observers, there is no record.

### Observation House
One of several outposts scattered across Degenora where Observers can rest, document findings, and access Terminal 7-B systems.

---

## 🔤 P

### PILL
A mysterious substance found throughout Degenora. Pills come in various colors and have different effects on specimens and Observers. The primary in-game currency and enhancement mechanic.

### Pondwatcher
A specimen type that guards wetland territories. Named for their habit of remaining motionless for hours, watching the surface of the water.

---

## 🔤 R

### Record
Documentation that is believed to be accurate but has not been fully verified. Records have `truth_level: record` in their frontmatter.

### Rug
Both a physical artifact (a mysterious woven object found on Degenora) and a slang term for unfortunate outcomes. The origin of "The Rug" remains unknown.

### Rumor
Unverified information, often passed between Observers. May contain truth, may contain fiction. Rumors have `truth_level: rumor` in their frontmatter.

---

## 🔤 S

### Schema
The standardized format for all archive entries. Defined in [schema.md](./schema.md). Ensures consistency across the knowledge base.

### Shadow Stalker
A specimen type that hunts at night. Known for their ability to blend into darkness and their preference for high-ground observation points.

### Signal, The
The mysterious force or entity that permeates Degenora. The Signal mutates specimens, broadcasts through Kermit, and seems to have its own unknowable agenda. Origin: Unknown. Intent: Unknown.

> *"The Signal doesn't speak our language. That's where I come in."* — Kermit

### Signal Mutation
The process by which exposure to the Signal alters a specimen's biology. All mutations on Degenora are Signal mutations.

### Specimen
Any creature, plant, or entity found on Degenora that has been documented by Observers. Specimens are the primary focus of the archive.

### Swamp
The central ecosystem of Degenora. Wet, dangerous, and strangely beautiful. The Swamp is where most Signal activity is concentrated.

---

## 🔤 T

### Terminal 7-B
The central communications and documentation hub for Degenora. Access point for the archive, specimen database, and Observer tools. Administered by Kermit.

### Toaddy
An AI assistant that helps Observers with onboarding, questions, and navigation. More helpful and less cryptic than Kermit.

### Truth Level
A metadata field indicating the reliability of archive content. Values: `canon`, `record`, `rumor`, `corrupted`, `redacted`.

---

## 🔤 V

### Void
The empty spaces between Signal broadcasts. The Void is not empty—it's waiting.

---

## 🔤 Y

### Year 0
The year of the Incident—the event that brought the Signal to Degenora and changed everything.

### Year 15
The current year. Degenora has been active for 15 years. The Signal has been broadcasting for 15 years. We are still learning what that means.
