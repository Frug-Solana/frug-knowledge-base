# Contradictions & unresolved conflicts

This page tracks conflicts between sources (canon vs record vs corrupted). Each entry should propose a resolution path.

## Current list

### C-0001: Terminal 7-B — concept vs in-world node
- **Conflict:** Some sources describe Terminal 7-B as a *design/interface concept*; others present it *in-universe* as an active node.
- **Evidence:**
  - “public codex interface concept… designed to feel like a lab terminal” *(degenora-codex)*
  - “TERMINAL 7-B :: DEGENORA ACCESS NODE … SYNC :: ACTIVE” *(degenora-codex)*
  - Website presents it as an initializing protocol and addresses the reader as “OBSERVER”. *(frugsolana.xyz)*
- **Proposed resolution:** Treat “Terminal 7-B” as both:
  1) the diegetic interface the audience uses, and
  2) a real in-world system/ritual of access.
  This duality becomes part of the tone.
