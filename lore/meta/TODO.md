# TODO (lore encyclopedia)

## Priority (next)
- [ ] Section B: Timeline — split into canon vs record vs corrupted; add era scaffolding.
- [ ] Section C: Locations/Sectors — extract named territories/landmarks from public sources; build location pages with citations.
- [ ] Section D: Characters/Factions — add Observer/Frugowski, KERMIT, and any entities named in public sources.
- [ ] Add a `lore/pages/style_guide.md` (how to write pages consistently).

## Backlog
- [ ] Add a light “index generator” (optional) that validates frontmatter and lists chunks by tags.
- [ ] Convert/ingest degenora-codex entries into chunked canon pages with explicit truth levels.
