# Characters & Entities

This section indexes known entities. Individual entity pages should be concise, linkable, and cite their supporting chunks.

## Index (starter)
- **FRUG** — _TBD_ (`truth_level` varies by document)
- **Operators** — _TBD_
- **Agents** — _TBD_

## Page template
Recommended fields:
- Summary (1–3 lines)
- Known aliases
- Associations (factions/systems)
- Notable sightings (link to chunks)
- `truth_level` / `confidence` notes
