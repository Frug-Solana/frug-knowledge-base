# Timeline (draft)

> This timeline is a **container** for dated/relative events. Specific events should be added as separate chunks and then linked here.

## Eras (placeholder)

### Era: Pre-Launch
- _TBD_ (add chunks with `chronology: relative: pre-launch`)

### Era: Launch Window
- _TBD_

### Era: Post-Incident Drift
- _TBD_

## Contributing an event
Create a new chunk in `lore/chunks/` with YAML frontmatter including:
- `id`
- `truth_level` / `confidence`
- `chronology` (absolute or relative)
- `entities` / `locations` where possible

Then add a bullet link here.
