# Core premise

## Summary (1 minute)
**Degenora Island** is the narrative setting of FRUG: an open-world style map/setting documented through field reports, dossiers, and terminal outputs.

The reader enters through **Terminal 7-B**, presented as a public-access interface for browsing an evolving archive.

## Known
- Degenora Island is explicitly described as the narrative setting for FRUG and framed like an open-world map.  
  **Citation:** `degenora-codex/codex/degenora-island.md` @ `a43332ad…`
- Terminal 7-B is described as a public, read-only codex interface concept for browsing the Degenora archive (with “lab terminal” presentation).  
  **Citation:** `degenora-codex/lore/terminal-7b.md` @ `a43332ad…`
- Terminal 7-B is also presented as a “Degenora access node” with public clearance and routes/commands for MAP/REPORTS/SPECIMENS/LAB.  
  **Citation:** `degenora-codex/codex/index.md` @ `a43332ad…`

## Unknown
- The full canonical backstory of how/why the archive exists.
- The authoritative list of territories and what “sectors” officially mean.

## Speculative (do not treat as canon)
- The archive may be self-modifying or adversarial (commonly implied by “corrupted log” tone, but not canonized yet).
