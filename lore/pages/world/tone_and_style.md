# Tone & presentation style

## The vibe (what a reader should feel)
- **Terminal-lit mystery:** information arrives as prompts, outputs, routes, and system headers.
- **Field-science documentation:** the world is recorded through **reports**, **specimens**, and **lab-style dossiers**.
- **Conviction over heroics:** FRUG is framed as exhausted persistence rather than a savior narrative.

## Canon presentation formats
These formats are treated as *in-universe lenses*:
- **Terminal pages** (commands, routes, clearance blocks)
- **Field reports** (location + summary + notes)
- **Specimen dossiers** (identity + placement + hooks)

## Example tone markers (public sources)
- Terminal pages are explicitly presented as “public access / read only” and “designed to feel like a lab terminal.”  
  **Citation:** `degenora-codex` @ `a43332ad…`
- Website copy frames FRUG as “not a hero story… a frog who’s seen too much” and introduces Degenora with terminal/protocol language.  
  **Citation:** `frugsolana.xyz` (Lore + Degenora pages)

## Writing guidance for this repo (wiki style)
- Use crisp definitions.
- Separate **Known / Unknown / Speculative**.
- Include a short **Examples** subsection whenever possible.
- End with **Sources** (permalinks).
