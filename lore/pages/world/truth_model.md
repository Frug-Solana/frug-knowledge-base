# Truth model (canon vs record vs corrupted)

This encyclopedia uses explicit truth labels so readers can distinguish:
- what is **fixed canon**
- what is a **record** (in-universe documentation)
- what is **rumor/corrupted/redacted** material

## Definitions
- **canon** — accepted ground truth for the setting.
- **record** — an in-universe document presented “as recovered.” May be biased.
- **rumor** — hearsay; keep separate until corroborated.
- **corrupted** — partial/garbled; treat as suspicious.
- **redacted** — intentionally withheld; existence is meaningful, content is not.

## How to promote something to canon
1) Create a canon chunk in `lore/chunks/` or a canon page in `lore/pages/`.
2) Include a **Sources** section with permalinks.
3) If conflicting sources exist, add an entry to [Contradictions](../../meta/CONTRADICTIONS.md).

## Why this matters for FRUG
The public materials intentionally use “terminal/archive” framing, so ambiguity is part of the experience.
