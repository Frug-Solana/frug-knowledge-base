# World overview

> **Section A:** World overview + core premise + tone.

## Start here (recommended order)
1) [World Index](world/INDEX.md)
2) [Core premise](world/core_premise.md)
3) [Tone & presentation style](world/tone_and_style.md)
4) [Truth model (canon vs record vs corrupted)](world/truth_model.md)

## Elevator pitch
**Degenora Island** is the narrative setting for FRUG—framed like an open-world map whose details are revealed through field reports, specimens, and terminal-style documentation.

The reader enters through **Terminal 7-B**, presented as a public-access, read-only interface for browsing the Degenora archive.

## Known (ground truth, cited)
- **Degenora Island** is explicitly stated as the narrative setting for FRUG and described like an open-world map.  
  → See: [Core premise](world/core_premise.md)
- **Terminal 7-B** is presented as a public, read-only codex interface concept; it is designed to feel like a lab terminal.  
  → See: [Systems / Terminal](systems/terminal.md)

## Tone pillars (what stays consistent)
- **Terminal-lit mystery:** clearance headers, routes, prompts, partial records.
- **Field-science documentation:** the world is “known” through reports and dossiers, not omniscient narration.
- **Conviction over heroics:** FRUG’s voice is tired persistence, not a savior arc.

## Unknown (not yet canonized)
- The authoritative list of sectors/territories and their boundaries.
- The “operators” behind Terminal 7-B (if any) and their motives.

## Speculative (keep separate)
- Archives that can “fight back” (corruption/adversarial behavior) — treat as tone until a canon chunk establishes it.

## Where details live
- **Timeline:** [lore/pages/timeline.md](timeline.md)
- **Locations/Sectors:** [lore/pages/locations/README.md](locations/README.md)
- **Characters/Entities:** [lore/pages/characters/README.md](characters/README.md)
- **Archive-style docs:** [lore/pages/archive_fragments.md](archive_fragments.md)
