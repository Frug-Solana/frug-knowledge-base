# World overview

## What is this setting?
A living, contested space where **the Terminal** (see: [Systems / Terminal](systems/terminal.md)) mediates access, authority, and memory.

This page is intentionally high-level; details should live in dedicated chunks/pages and be linked back here.

## Pillars (draft)
- **Access is a weapon:** permissions, keys, and credentials decide what is real.
- **Memory is fallible:** archives can be corrupted, redacted, or forged.
- **The map is not the territory:** sectors and labels shift; names drift.

## What we *don’t* know (yet)
- The authoritative list of sectors and their boundaries.
- The canonical origin of the Terminal and its operators.
