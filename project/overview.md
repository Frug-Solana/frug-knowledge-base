# Project Overview

## What is FRUG?

FRUG is an **art-first meme coin** on Solana with a **living narrative**. It's a cultural experiment where:

- **Art comes first** — Visuals, worldbuilding, and storytelling drive everything
- **The narrative evolves** — Community contributions shape the Degenora Island lore
- **Conviction > Market cap** — We're here for the long journey, not quick pumps

---

## The World: Degenora Island

Degenora is the setting for the FRUG universe — an island ecosystem where the rules of biology and physics seem to bend.

### Key Elements

| Element | Description |
|---------|-------------|
| **The Signal** | A mysterious force that mutates specimens and broadcasts through Terminal 7-B |
| **Specimens** | Creatures and entities found on the island, documented by Observers |
| **Terminal 7-B** | The central communications hub — your interface to the archive |
| **Observers** | Community members who explore, document, and contribute to the canon |
| **KERMIT** | The AI system that manages Terminal 7-B transmissions |

---

## The Culture

**Conviction over market cap.** We build for the long term.

**Art over noise.** Quality visuals and storytelling matter more than hype.

**Community canon.** The lore is shaped by those who participate.

---

## Terminal 7-B

The primary interface for the FRUG ecosystem:

- **Live feed** — Real-time transmissions from KERMIT and the system
- **Field reports** — Observer-submitted documentation
- **Specimen database** — Catalog of known entities
- **Clearance system** — Progressive unlocking based on engagement

**Access Terminal 7-B:** https://frug-solana.github.io/degenora-codex/terminal/index.html

## Token ($FRUG)

The FRUG token is the economic layer of Degenora:

- **Contract:** `EBnA9HbJkhRTP1n1ZCkZzNCGjLssRWTetBFL9nzPpump`
- **Fixed supply** — No inflation
- **Immutable** — Parameters cannot be changed
- **Utility** — Used for in-world mechanics, clearance, and participation
