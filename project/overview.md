# Overview

FRUG is an art-first meme coin on Solana with a living narrative universe.

## The World

**Degenora Island** is the setting—a mysterious ecosystem where the Signal mutates specimens and Observers document the unknown.

## Terminal 7-B

The primary interface for the FRUG ecosystem:
- **Live transmissions** — Kermit AI-generated lore drops and system events
- **Field reports** — Community-submitted observations
- **Specimen database** — Documented creatures and entities
- **Interactive map** — Navigate Degenora's sectors
- **Observer profiles** — Wallet-linked identity and clearance system

**Access:** https://frugsolana.xyz

## Key Features (Shipped)
